Most of the people there weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t second-years, but first-years. I supposed that many students saw this meet-and-greet as an important opportunity. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Since I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who the first-years were at a glance right now anyway, I decided to start by finding out which second-year students were participating in this event. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The leader of Class A, Sakayanagi, was nowhere to be seen. And while I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I could exactly call him a stand-in for her, I did see Hashimoto Masayoshi. Sakayanagi had a disability affecting her legs, so her range of movement was limited, making her slow. Hashimoto played an important part in covering her to make up for\\xc2\\xa0that. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">As far as I could tell, he was the only person from Class\\xc2\\xa0A here. Furthermore, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem like he was making an attempt to talk to anyone in particular. He was probably scouting around to see who got in touch with whom at this meet-and-greet.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">As the organizer for this event, about half of the people from Class B were in attendance, both guys and girls, Ichinose included. Kanzaki was there too, by Ichinose\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side, supporting her. However, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the impression that the students in attendance from Class B were those that were either very good students or those who were concerned about their academic prowess. It seemed Class\\xc2\\xa0B had simply chosen to send the more sociable members of their class.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">On the other hand, after briefly looking around, I saw no sign of anyone from Class C around. It was almost as if they considered this meet-and-greet to be totally optional, right from the very beginning. Through this one event alone, you could somehow see the motives of each of the second-year classes. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">However, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the second-year students who were important to Horikita today. She was focused on the first-years\\xe2\\x80\\x94the people we hardly knew at all. I was sure that the first-year students, who had only just started here, had no clue as to what was going on yet. Many of them were probably struggling to wrap their heads around the situation with second-year students suddenly asking to pair up with them. They shrank back from everyone else at the event, clinging to their classmates\\xe2\\x80\\x94which is to say, the students that they were already close with.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Upon seeing that, Ichinose tried her best to expand their circle by making self-introductions and casual chit-chat, without really mentioning the special exam. Of course, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like people were about to immediately open up or anything. Knowing this, she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rush things, but instead approached people slowly, looking at them with a gentle smile on her face. Then their hardened hearts, which seemed to have been frozen like ice, began to thaw. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">After only a few minutes of observation at this meet-and-greet, I had a general idea of how things were going to go from here.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRather than prioritizing the special exam, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going about building relationships based on mutual trust, first. That is certainly a very Ichinose-san-like way of doing things. An admirable tactic, and one not everyone can pull off,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita, giving her first impression of the meet-and-greet.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It was unknown just how much Class B was going to make use of this strategy, but it was especially important, nonetheless. What Ichinose was doing could only benefit both the first- and second-year students. Horikita called Ichinose \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadmirable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for putting such a plan into action. Looking at Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side profile, I could guess at the strategy she must have been thinking of herself.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you thinking of a similar strategy yourself?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I asked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Yes. A strategy based on using Private Points is too much for Class D to handle. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I thought it would be important for us to build relationships based on trust with the first-years. However, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no match for Ichinose-san in that regard at all. Or rather, I should say, that kind of strategy is her specialty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If you wanted someone to accept you as their partner, you needed to offer them something. That something could be a lot of different things, like points, trust, friendship, or a debt of gratitude.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIchinose Honami-san from Class 2-B is already quite well-known among many of the first-years. They know her name and face. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure anxious students will flock to her, and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll live up to their expectations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, I think so too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">They weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to bother coming up to us, Class 2-D, people they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know at all.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut even if we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t duplicate her admirable methods, there are things we </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">can</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Apparently, Horikita had gotten some kind of idea from this event. The crux of that idea probably had something to do with how she was constantly looking at the first-years with the OAA app open. She gave no sign of wanting to leave yet, continuing to observe the first-years. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only one standing beside her, watching, either. A large figure moved by us.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, y\\xe2\\x80\\x99know, all of \\xe2\\x80\\x99em look like total wimps. Every last one of \\xe2\\x80\\x99em,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d gruffed Sudou, standing beside Horikita, sharing what he thought about the first-years.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Sudou had originally planned to head straight for his club activities right after class today. But because Ichinose\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request to hold this meet-and-greet event was accepted, and it was thus suddenly decided that the gym would be in use until five o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, he offered to accompany Horikita here. Horikita had flatly turned him down, telling him it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessary for him to come, but I guess it must have been fine in the end, since he was going to the gym anyway.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t glare at them for no reason. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing to gain by scaring them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really glarin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or anything. This is just the way my face looks. Anyway, is it really okay for us to hang back and chill like this? Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the brainy kids get snatched up by Ichinose? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the harm in just talkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to \\xe2\\x80\\x99em?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou impatiently, suggesting to Horikita that they ought to go and talk to the students sooner rather than\\xc2\\xa0later.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even if a student from our grade level that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in Class B went to make a move on one of the first-years, Ichinose wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get upset about it. If anything, I was sure she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d welcome that happily.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are you gonna do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I asked Horikita, since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been wondering about that myself.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you really think we can outdo Class 2-B in a place like this, when it comes to socializing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Right now, Ichinose seemed to be emphasizing providing relief for the first-years over trying to make sure her own class would win. From the looks of things, not a single one of the students from Class B had left yet, and they seemed to be trying to get to know the first-years better, to deepen their friendships. I bet the first-years had noticed their enthusiasm, too.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really imagine that we could,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If Yousuke or Kushida were here, we could\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve stood a chance at schmoozing. Maybe. But Horikita, Sudou, and I most definitely lacked the ability to hold our own, socially. I was sure Horikita was well aware of that fact when she came here. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Just as the discussion was about to begin in earnest, Horikita took action.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Instead of participating in the meet-and-greet, we were retreating. Which meant Horikita had had no intention of trying to bring any of the first-years over to our side at this event all along.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou sure that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay, Suzune?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMore than half of the students who were invited didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come to this meet-and-greet. Those are the students I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to negotiate with,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In other words, she was going to target the first-year students who hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bothered to listen to Ichinose\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offer. At the same time, however, the fact that those students ignored Ichinose\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offer proved it would be difficult to win them over. They might think they could find a partner by themselves, based on their own abilities, without accepting a helping hand. Or perhaps they lacked the courage to come out to this meet-and-greet. They might even already have a strategy in mind. Whatever the case might be, we could assume many of them probably would be a little eccentric, and hard to deal with. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the time being, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hear your basis for going that route,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo reasons. As far as I can tell, from what I saw just moments earlier, an unexpectedly high percentage of the students who came to the meet-and-greet were people concerned about their academic prowess. What we are looking for right now, rather urgently I might add, are students who have at least a B minus or better in academic ability. Meaning, the students who have enough confidence to do battle without coming to the meet-and-greet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I see. If that was the case, I supposed it made a certain amount of sense for us to have left the meet-and-greet.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur top priority shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be to pair two A-rank students with one another. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about coaxing students with enough academic ability to cover for the weaker students in our class to come to our side, to make sure that absolutely no one gets expelled,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">However, even if Class 2-B did save a lot of the first-years, there would naturally be a lot of them left over. Moreover, Ichinose was probably going to prioritize saving the less capable students over helping the highly capable ones. It was possible that we could have picked up some of the leftover students from the meet-and-greet\\xe2\\x80\\x94ones who were better students, to an extent. I\\xc2\\xa0assumed\\xc2\\xa0her second reason had something to do with that.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides, there was a little bit of a bias in the students who attended the meet-and-greet, regardless of academic ability,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBias?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe fact that none of the students from Class 1-D attended at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">None of them had attended? I see. That certainly was a rather interesting bias. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems like you understand, too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Horikita said.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnderstand what? What does the fact that none of the kids from Class 1-D showed up mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Sudou, cutting in. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">He cocked his head to the side, not understanding what the significance of their absence was.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are forty people in one class. Among those forty are students with poor grades and students who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t particularly good at communication. And yet, not a single person from Class 1-D participated. The fact that no one had attended is obviously a reflection of the will of the class,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It was clear that someone was controlling the entire class, and had instructed them not to participate in the meet-and-greet. You could certainly say that was unusual, considering that it hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even been a few days since the semester started.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s already a leader in their class, and that person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kept \\xe2\\x80\\x99em from going to this meet-and-greet\\xe2\\x80\\xa6?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a person we can negotiate with who speaks for the entire class, then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no longer necessary for us to try and bargain with people individually,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In other words, her strategy was for the students in each of our classes, 1-D and 2-D, to cover one another.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOkay, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all well and good. But if we do that, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not gonna stand a chance at winnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 this thing, are we?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sudou asked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a bad idea at all, to keep anyone from getting expelled. But it would probably make it impossible for us to beat the other classes in overall scores.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right. In that sense, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not planning to wage war with the other classes this time around,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly in a position to really say much of anythin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about that, but are you sure that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you want?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. Without a doubt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stated Horikita, clearly and definitively.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Although her approach was certainly different, the general idea behind her strategy was similar to Ichinose\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, from the sound of it. The thinking was that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be giving up your chance at a valuable opportunity to get Class Points, a special exam. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Class A\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hashimoto was already leaving the gym, perhaps because he was done snooping around Ichinose\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meet-and-greet event. Horikita followed Hashimoto, proceeding to the gym exit. Sudou and I followed her. But just before I left, I briefly looked back at Ichinose. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ichinose, not noticing my presence, was talking to a first-year student with a smile on her face. I was sure she wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hesitate to extend a helping hand, regardless of that student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic ability score. Even if it was D or E. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She was fighting to prevent anyone in her class from getting expelled, abandoning the idea of achieving victory in this special exam. It was about the same as what Horikita was trying to do, albeit in a different way. Or </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">was </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">it? Was the essence of their strategies really the same? </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Just as we left the gym, Hashimoto called out to us, as if he had been waiting for us.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMan, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same as ever, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t she? Ichinose, I mean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prioritizing saving her classmates and the first-years, yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, for sure. Definitely doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem like Ichinose\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a threat at the moment. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t she get what a disadvantage it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be for her to take in a bunch of morons? Man, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s throwin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the game,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hashimoto exasperatedly. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">There was no way he could have realized Horikita was going for pretty much the same thing, probably because he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even imagine the thought of Horikita giving up on trying to win.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because she already knew that about the first-years that she was able to set up a meeting like this in the first place?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, yeah, I getcha. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hashimoto.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou Class A people\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Sakayanagi-san understood without even needing to see the meet-and-greet. The reason she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t participate was because she already anticipated what kind of students were going to show up here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, maybe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hashimoto.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even so, she had probably sent Hashimoto in alone as a scout.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, how are you planning to get the honors students over to your side?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all up to the princess. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just following her orders.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">With that reply, Hashimoto started to walk away, perhaps because he was satisfied with the brief exchange we just had.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trust a word that jerkoff Hashimoto says, Suzune.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to tell me that. Wait, are you familiar with Hashimoto-kun?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNope, not at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou proudly, arrogantly.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I see. Well, Class A has a big advantage simply by being Class A. I suppose it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only natural that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have some people flocking to them, to a certain extent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Having enrolled here, the new students were eventually going to realize that Class A reigned supreme. Even if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that fact right now, word would get around quickly.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyway, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hurry. Class D students should still be hanging around at school at this hour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita, heading towards the first-year classrooms.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">We were going to see what things were like for Class 1-D. Apparently, she was seizing the opportunity presented to us while everyone else was focused on the meet-and-greet.</span></p>\\n<div style=\"page-break-after: always;\"/>\\n<p class=\"P_TEXTBODY_CENTERALIGN_PAGEBREAK\"><span><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.27em;\">4.1</span></span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.40em;\">W</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.80em;\">E MADE OUR WAY</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> to the floor where the first-year students were\\xe2\\x80\\x94the floor we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been regularly going to until just last month. There didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to be many students around, considering that quite a few had gone over to the gym. We looked around and saw several students, from Class A through Class C. Even though we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually call out to them, when they spotted us and recognized us as upperclassmen, they looked away, as if it were awkward or uncomfortable.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I supposed there was no way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be welcomed with open arms all that easily, after suddenly setting foot on the first-years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 floor. There were a few students who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to mind us, but most of them didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly like the uncomfortable awkwardness of having us there. That would probably be the case tomorrow, and every day thereafter, too. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I was sure that some students, trying to find a partner as soon as possible, would approach first-years at all times of the day, both mornings and afternoons. But that was a dangerous gamble that might end up backfiring. Even so, there were students chatting and laughing happily in the first-year classrooms into which we peeked. Maybe they felt like there was no need to panic about this special exam. Or perhaps they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see it as that big a deal yet.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, it seems like a lot of the students who had stayed behind aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too worried, after all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice. And here I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m freakin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out and all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d gruffed Sudou. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The first-year students would only have their Private Point payouts suspended for three months if they scored five hundred points or less on the exam. That was still definitely a huge loss, of course, but since the initial deposit into their accounts should have been made right after the entrance ceremony, they probably felt no sense of impending danger.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Just as we were finishing our inspection of Class 1-C, Horikita heard a familiar voice call out to her.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Ku ku</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">. You got here pretty late, Suzune.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The owner of that voice was none other than Ryuuen Kakeru, from Class 2-C, staring at us fearlessly. Just up ahead, we could see the classroom for Class 1-D. It looked like Ryuuen had just stepped out of that room.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you here scouting out first-year students too, Ryuuen-kun? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recall seeing you at the meet-and-greet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was just a buncha moronic half-wits who got together at the gym, right? I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even need to go see it to know </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">that</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">He had come here looking for students who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to the meet-and-greet, just like Horikita had been planning to do. Judging from the way he was talking, it was clear he was after the top-level first-year students. There had been only about a slight twenty- or thirty-minute difference in our timing, but\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">With that much time, it was possible that he had already successfully scouted a number of students. We would be able to check whether each student had settled on a partner at eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock the next morning. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRelax. Still haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t settled on anybody yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Not that the other two people with me today would believe him so easily, though. That is, until the app actually refreshed, and it showed what partnerships had been finalized or not for Class 2-C.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou look like you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m taking everything you say with a grain of salt, at the very least,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuh, okay. Looks like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten pretty </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">wary</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> of me, huh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh? I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recall ever once </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">not</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> being wary of you before though. Hm?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Kukuku</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">! Well, yeah, guess you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a point there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Sudou glared at Ryuuen, perhaps not liking the mocking way he spoke to Horikita. A normal person would have shrunk back in fear from that glare alone, but such a direct attack wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work on Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooks like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve hired yourself a bodyguard. But you chose a dumb one, lady,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99d you say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d huffed Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">He looked ready to fly off the handle, but Horikita kept him in line with a gentle wave of her hand.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, do you need brains to be a bodyguard? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black, hm?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t avert her eyes from Ryuuen as she delivered that comeback, still holding her hand out to keep Sudou back. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you planning on scaring the first-years? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid that taking that kind of attitude with them is going to backfire on you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">They would certainly shrink back if they saw Ryuuen strutting about like he was the cock of the walk. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI figured if I threatened \\xe2\\x80\\x99em a little, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d immediately agree to cooperate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita had been going tit-for-tat with Ryuuen so far, dishing back what Ryuuen was giving her. But Ryuuen did the opposite this time, actually affirming what she had just suggested.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re kidding, right? Do you really think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an acceptable way of doing things?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAcceptable or not, who friggin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cares. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the problem if someone feels a little threatened? We were told that we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t force someone to get a lower score or anythin\\xe2\\x80\\x99, but there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anythin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about not using threats to find a partner in the rules,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because it should go without saying that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not okay, without it needing to be outlined in the rules. If there is a problem, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be in trouble,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen show me where the problem is. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gonna do somethin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dumb enough that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get traced back to me, anyway,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">He was as bullish and cocksure as ever. Not only was he saying it was extremely likely that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d make good on his threats, but he also stated, quite definitively, that the truth of the matter would never get out. Whether what he was saying was truth or falsehood, Horikita, too, must have realized once again that Ryuuen would always opt to rule with the iron hand of a military dictator.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, in that case, do whatever you like. But if any evidence should present itself, I will raise the issue, without question. Or mercy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Her warning was probably meant to serve as a deterrent, but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to resonate with Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo? You think </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">you</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> can win anybody over to your class?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita must have determined that there was no need for her to answer, because she kept her mouth shut.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou figured somethin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out when you were snoopin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 around the meet-and-greet, huh? And then you hurried on over here to see who was left. That it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe same as you then, perhaps?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Ku ku</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">. Yeah, maybe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ryuuen continued speaking to Horikita after saying that, as if all he wanted was to keep things interesting. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn that case, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell ya somethin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 good, since we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the same wavelength. This year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s batch of fresh meat are all </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">real</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> calm, even though they only just started here. Which means there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a real good chance that someone from the school is telling these new kids how things work, to a certain extent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If that was true, it was quite an unexpected bit of intel. Back in April, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d no idea what was going on, and everyone just messed around as much as they wanted as a result. Of course, the students from Class A and Class B were more composed, but that could probably be attributed to the significant difference between our backgrounds. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Also, what Ryuuen was talking about wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just a specific class. He was referring to the </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">entire grade</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">level</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">. Maybe this was a measure that had been taken because they had to partner up with second-year students right at the start of school? Or did the school have other intentions, perhaps?</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIsn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it possible that this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s batch of new students are just especially quick-witted, and we were just exceptionally slow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signs that some of \\xe2\\x80\\x99em are already coming together, as a class, right at this stage. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way too early.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d immediately started trying to come together as a class when the special exam was announced, they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have succeeded already. Ryuuen was saying they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have come together like this, now, unless they started the process at an early stage. Right after they entered the school.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6What kind of cowardly trick are you trying to pull by telling me this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99, no trick. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just pulverize your opponents in this special exam. Nothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 like that. But if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gonna win overall, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re probably gonna have to pull several strings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to be easy to get students from the other classes expelled in this special exam. The sense of anonymity in it, of wondering who was going to be partnered with who, was fairly significant. It was going to be quite difficult to ascertain exactly who people were partnered with on the app, unless people were going around making partnerships known publicly or you were very good at gathering information. Even if you were able to get classmates who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do so well academically to partner with students from rival classes, or even if you were to specifically designate someone for that purpose, it would be almost impossible to get that student to purposefully cut corners on the test.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If you got a low score\\xe2\\x80\\x94one out of keeping with the level of academic ability you were supposed to have\\xe2\\x80\\x94it would clearly be intentional, and then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get expelled regardless of what grade level you were in. In the end, the difference between victory and defeat came down to two things: the abilities of the students in your own class, and the abilities of the first-year students. In terms of strategy, what you could do was win as many academically skilled first-years over to your class as possible. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to be easy for Class C to come out on top in this exam, considering their low levels of overall ability. There was no way they could hope to compete with Class A financially, and the academic skills of the two classes were on entirely different levels. No matter how much money they threw at the first-years to try and poach them, the results weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to be pretty. In that case, they should abandon the idea of trying to win first place overall and aim instead for the individual competition, with rewards given to the top thirty percent.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Of course, Horikita didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make any mention of that. Because it would be a problem for us if Class A and Class C weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trying to duke it out with each other for overall points. Rather than let Class A easily snatch the top spot, I was hoping A and C would fight it out on a grand scale, so they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d wear each other down, if only a little. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTry your best to keep up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d chided Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose I could say the same to you. Your concerns are completely unnecessary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Ku ku</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">. Well, my bad.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Then Ryuuen immediately left, vacating the first-year students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 floor. He had been here too short a time to have finished what needed doing.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe first-years might resist us much more strongly than I thought they would,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If they were aware of the fact that they were basically locked in a desperate struggle to the death with the other classes at this school, then yes, I supposed it was only natural they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be hesitant to negotiate with us.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn that case, shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we try and negotiate with \\xe2\\x80\\x99em at least a little, as soon as we can?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Of course we should. But\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita directed her gaze towards the end of the hall. She was looking at where the classroom for Class 1-D\\xc2\\xa0was.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be that simple,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Apparently, Horikita had noticed it too while she was talking with Ryuuen. The entire time they talked, from when Ryuuen strolled out of the classroom to when he left, not a single student had been seen leaving the classroom. And we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear a single sound as we approached the room, either. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When we eventually reached the door to the classroom and opened it, our suspicions were confirmed.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cD-dude, what the hell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d yelled Sudou in a panic, as he scanned the inside of the classroom from end to end.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNegotiating with Class 1-D might be much, much more difficult than I expected,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The classroom was completely empty. There wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a single person in sight. The forty students, who hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shown up to the meet-and-greet either, seemed to have suddenly disappeared without a trace.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis class might be more trouble than I had thought,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">However, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like we could just sit here and wallow in our anxiety. We needed to take action before the other classes really started making their moves in earnest. The competition was starting tomorrow. Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s battle was going to begin the moment that she contacted Class 1-D. As for me, I was going to head back to my dorm and memorize all the names and faces of the new students in the OAA app. Horikita had her battle to fight, and I had mine. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">And as it turned out, on the day the special exam was announced, a total of twenty-two partnerships had been finalized.</span></p>\\n<div style=\"page-break-after: always;\"/>\\n<p class=\"P_TEXTBODY_CENTERALIGN_PAGEBREAK\"><span><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.27em;\">4.2</span></span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\">\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.40em;\">T</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.80em;\">HE SITUATION TOOK A SUDDEN</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.80em;\">,</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> unexpected turn near the end of our lunch break on the next day. Something happened after we had finished eating our lunches, while we sat in our classroom, casually waiting for our afternoon classes to begin.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH-hey! Dudes! Some first-years are headed this way!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted one of my classmates, Miyamoto.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">This special exam depended on first- and second-year students working together. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d think this wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be such a surprising development, but apparently, that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the case.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWow, they must be awfully brave to come up to the upperclassmen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s floor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Yousuke, while I mulled things over in my head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean, if we decided to head up to the third-year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s floor, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have to be very careful not to make a fuss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It would be a different story if you had a lot of close friendships with your senpai, but for this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s batch of new students, that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the case. Many of them must have felt like they were venturing into enemy territory. I\\xc2\\xa0supposed that in that sense, some of them showing up like this might actually be an event that merited surprise. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Yousuke said he was going to go check it out, so I followed him, heading out into the hallway. Horikita and Sudou followed right after us. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The first thing that caught my eye was a guy with a particularly large build. There were several reasons why he stood out, one of which was that he seemed to be around Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s height. But, more than that, it was the strong impression he made as he walked confidently down the center of the hall on our floor. The other second-year students in the hall avoided him, walking at the edges of the hallway. Which seemed like the opposite of what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d normally expect. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Following a little way behind this student was a girl. Horikita, realizing that they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t simply here looking for partners, stepped out in front of the male student to block his path. Sudou stuck close to her.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When Horikita and Sudou came face-to-face with these new students, the first-year student made eye contact with me for some reason, even though I was watching from some distance away. Shortly afterward, he looked away from me and shifted his gaze to Horikita. I\\xc2\\xa0pulled up the data I had learned from the OAA yesterday in my memory. It seemed Horikita was about to make rather unexpected contact with </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">that</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> class.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this chick?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the guy.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease wait a moment\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the girl.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">After fiddling with her phone for a short while, she showed him her screen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cClass 2-D. Horikita Suzune. Academic ability A-, huh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the guy, gruffly.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The girl spoke in a rather polite tone of voice, unlike the guy, which made them seem like quite the odd combination. They then directed their gazes over at Sudou, who was standing beside Horikita. And just like before, the girl showed the guy her phone screen. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSudou Ken\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Heh.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After looking at Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data, the guy let out a mocking snort.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello, my name is Nanase, from Class 1-D. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from the same class. This is\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHousen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, interrupting her.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">They both gave us their last names. Just for reference, the large guy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s full name was Housen Kazuomi and the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was Nanase Tsubasa. They were both genuine Class\\xc2\\xa01-D students, just as they had said they were. Students from the very same that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d tried to meet with yesterday, but couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. </span></p>\\n<div style=\"page-break-after: always;\"/>\\n<section epub:type=\"frontmatter titlepage\">\\n    <img alt=\"Front Image1\" class=\"insert\" src=\"../Images/INTERIORIMAGES_2.jpg\"/>\\n  </section>\\n<div style=\"page-break-after: always;\"/>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting__And__Page_Break\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Although their sudden arrival here was rather unexpected, it was both a lucky break and a stroke of ill fortune for Horikita. That was because we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly start negotiating with Class 1-D out in the open, while under the watchful eyes of the other classes.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor a couple of new students, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done something quite brave. I admire your pluck,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuh? What, you admire our </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">pluck? </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t act so high and mighty, woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d snapped Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 high and mighty, dude. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get all full of yourself, kid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Housen had snapped at Horikita, causing Sudou to snap back at him in turn. Even though they were about the same height, Housen had a slightly bigger build, making Sudou look a bit smaller in comparison.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDude, your score\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an E+. Guess you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just as much of a moron as you look,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat was that?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, whatever, this is fine. Looks like this place is crawling with Class D rejects anyway. Works for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is that supposed to mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I said, you Class D punks are all just a bunch of rejects, leftovers. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even form pairs unless we pick you. So I figured, hey, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll lend you incompetent, braindead morons a hand. You get what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\xc2\\xa0Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It was almost as if he was testing Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeaning you want us to team up with you. And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making your request with a rather condescending attitude,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUh, yeah? I mean, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the ones who should be beggin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 us to team up with you. Hell, I even dragged myself all the way out here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Housen snapped back at Horikita, basically implying we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in remotely the same position. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on. Go ahead and beg. Say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Please, please team up with us,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and start bowin\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita, still holding Sudou back to keep him from losing his temper, argued back at him, her words growing in intensity despite the difference in size between her and Housen. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem to be misunderstanding something. Our positions are equal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEqual? Your idiot friend over there oughta be the only one spewing bullshit like that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in Class D, just like us. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no difference between us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it. There are </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">plenty</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> of things we can do to you if we feel like it. Get it? I mean, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want trouble, right? Then you should know your place and start beggin\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Apparently, this Housen person had already noticed that the first-years had a secret weapon they could use to their advantage. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd just what are these things you could do to us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita. She likely already knew the answer, but deliberately asked anyway, to make Housen come out and say it.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on, you know, dontcha? What I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is that we can get bad test scores, on purpose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When Horikita heard him say that, she bit her lip with some force.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuh?! Enough already, you little first-year punk! You mess up the test, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get kicked outta school!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStop. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be so quick to lose your cool, Sudou-kun. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad habit of yours,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I could understand why Sudou would want to vent his anger after hearing Housen talk to Horikita like that. However, what Housen was saying wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a lie.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true that if you mess up on the test on purpose, you get expelled. But the penalty for not bein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 able to find a partner before time\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up is different. That only applies to you guys, right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The rules stated that if you ran out of time before you found a partner, one would be randomly assigned to you. On top of that, if you ran out of time, it would result in a 5 percent penalty taken off your overall score. And the second-year students, who could face expulsion, would take more damage from that penalty.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI-is that really true?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Sudou, incredulous.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">He shot Horikita a pleading look, seeking confirmation on whether what Housen said was true. The only answer she could possibly give him was \\xe2\\x80\\x98yes.\\xe2\\x80\\x99</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you be putting a noose around your own neck by doing that, though? Do you really intend on taking a loss immediately after you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started school?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If you got hit with a penalty, your chances of getting five hundred and one points or more on the test would naturally plummet.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, compared to you guys, can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get hurt all that bad. Ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered Housen. He looked to the girl standing behind him, Nanase, for confirmation.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s correct. We wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any Private Points deposited into our account for three months, but that would still only be a maximum of two hundred forty thousand points. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it would be a fatal setback,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Nanase.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet the picture now, Horikita</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">-</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">senpai?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Housen regarded Horikita as though he were superior to her, even though she was his senior. Sudou, seeing him treat her that way, must have lost his patience. He stood in front of Horikita now, exuding intimidation, though he still wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t throwing any punches.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou wanna go?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen, without any hesitation whatsoever.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get too full of yourself, punk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d huffed Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lose your cool, Sudou-kun. You do understand how things work at this school, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t unreasonable for the new students not to know this, but the hallways were supervised quite closely by school officials. The surveillance cameras were constantly monitoring us, so if there was a problem, the school officials could go dig up the footage.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">After having been repeatedly admonished by Horikita, Sudou backed off, though he looked irritated. It was certainly a problem that he got riled up so easily, but I supposed the fact that all it took was a word from Horikita to keep him in check was a relief.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Just then, as Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention was focused on Horikita, Housen thrust his large hand forward against Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chest and shoved him.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWha-?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In the next instant, Sudou lost his balance, falling backward, landing on his hands.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHa, only thing big about you is your height, loser. Just a little tap was all it took?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">What Housen just did was so reckless that even the other second-year students watching the situation couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hide their unease. Considering how dramatic the action had been, it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been surprising for it to be seen as an act of violence. If you understood how difficult and risky it was to try and do something violent in this school, you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d thought this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s batch of new students were more familiar with how things worked at this school than students from previous years. If the information we had gotten from Ryuuen the other day was true, then I had to say what Housen had just done was quite reckless.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Maybe they actually didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand the school as well as we thought they did? No, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem like that was the case. If so, then\\xe2\\x80\\xa6</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsshole!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Sudou, having regained his composure and realized what had just been done to him, looked ready to let all his pent-up anger explode at once. But right before that happened, another guy, who had been watching the situation from afar, jumped in.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDude, the hell are you doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It was Ishizaki Daiichi from Class 2-C. He was quick to lose his temper and could be easily categorized as a delinquent, but he was also a compassionate person. It seemed like he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d run out of patience after seeing Sudou, someone from his grade level, being treated with such cruelty.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMan, these losers just keep poppin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up outta nowhere, one after another. Like cockroaches,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen with a smirk, as if he found the situation amusing.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The girl who had introduced herself earlier as Nanase moved to rein him back in.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHousen-kun, I thought we came here to have a discussion? If we came here just so you could get violent, then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be leaving,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nanase.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cViolent? All I did was touch the guy, like I was pettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a cat or somethin\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Well, sorry, my bad, </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Sudou</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen, purposefully addressing Sudou without an honorific, as if he were spitting on him.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey, man, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 too far! Knock that crap off!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Ishizaki, reaching out to grab Housen by his collar.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The moment that Housen saw Ishizaki\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm reaching for him, though, the corners of his mouth curved up slightly into a smirk.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter think twice, Ishizaki, unless you wanna die,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d someone warned.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ishizaki stopped just before he took hold of Housen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collar. The warning had come from none other than Ryuuen, who had also been standing by, watching.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWh-why\\xe2\\x80\\x99d you stop me?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d huffed Ishizaki. He seemed visibly confused by the fact that Ryuuen had stopped him. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ibuki, a classmate of theirs, was also surprised by what Ryuuen had just done. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing? By stopping him, I mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ryuuen generally welcomed fights. He was the furthest possible thing from a person who hated trouble. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care if there were security cameras around or not; when he wanted to throw down, he did so without hesitation. Which was precisely why it was so surprising to see him stop a fight from happening. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ryuuen ordered Ishizaki back and then approached Housen himself.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, what, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re supposed to be my opponent now? Dude, you look weak compared to that moron Sudou over there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen mockingly, after getting a look at Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ryuuen certainly wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a big and brawny guy. I supposed that was why Housen considered him weak.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know you pretty well, yeah. I remember hearin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that this Housen dude was a bit of a celebrity in my hometown. I never imagined he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d look like such a total braindead idiot, though,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Housen repeatedly hurled insults at Sudou over and over, calling him stupid, so Ryuuen threw the same insult right back in his face. Something that was honestly quite typical of Ryuuen. Normally, Ryuuen was an enemy to every class that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t his own, but it was heartening to see him stand up to Housen like this. In fact, Sudou had successfully managed to bottle up his anger thanks to the change in atmosphere.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cY-you know this dude, Ryuuen-san?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Ishizaki.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait. Ryuuen, you say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When Housen heard Ryuuen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name, the look on his face changed. And then his wide mouth cracked open into an amused smile.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey now, ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this somethin\\xe2\\x80\\x99? This has gotta be fate. Honestly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard your name get thrown around so much that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been pissin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me off, Ryuuen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWow, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got the brain cells to actually remember someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Apparently, these two had known about each other for some time now. It seemed like Housen, from Class 1-D, came from somewhere close to Ryuuen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hometown. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That said, looking at the relationship between Ryuuen and Ishizaki and Ibuki, it seemed safe to say that Ryuuen had made a full comeback. He had temporarily stepped down from his position, but he was beginning to take command of his class once again.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGotta say though, for the fabled Ryuuen to look all scrawny and pitiful\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Damn, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a shame,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeanwhile you look like just as much of a musclebound freak as I imagined,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cY\\xe2\\x80\\x99know, I swung around your old hangouts a couple of times because I was plannin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to beat the everlovin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shit out of you. But I guess the reason I never ran into you was because you were terrified of me and hid, huh? What, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been runnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 away and making your little soldiers do all the work? Is that it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Ku ku</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more like lady luck saved your ass, Housen. If you had met me back then, you certainly wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be acting like such a bigshot right now. I guess you really lucked out, \\xe2\\x80\\x99cause you can say you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lost to me yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cActually, I think you just ran with your tail between your legs. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to tell me that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not how it is, then how about we settle things, right here and now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Housen formed his giant hand into a fist, looking confident. If he knew who Ryuuen was in junior high, the impression he had of Ryuuen shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be all that different from the impression </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">we</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> had of Ryuuen. Perhaps he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see Ryuuen as someone that you want as an enemy?</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, hard pass. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t plannin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on fighting a gorilla like you when there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing in it for me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even though Housen was fixing for a fight, Ryuuen turned his offer down. Of course, that was because there was no way that he could actually fight in a place like this, but\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I was sure Ishizaki and Ibuki had thought Ryuuen would accept the offer, even if that meant they had to take the fight elsewhere. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait, is this dude all that dangerous? I mean, sure, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bigger than Sudou and all, but\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ishizaki.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho can say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ryuuen seemed to have no intention of giving a straight answer to that question. Then he issued an order to his subordinates, a smirk on his face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you really okay with letting a first-year disrespect you like this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Ibuki. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She was aware of the fact that it was in Ryuuen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nature to throw down against anyone, no matter who it was. That was why she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help but ask him that question.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeh. We can settle things whenever. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the rush?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Ryuuen, quietly and calmly.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">While it would have been fine had things ended right there, Housen started walking forward, closing the distance between himself and Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that chick one of your little soldiers too?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Housen, after having watched them bicker earlier. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, somethin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 like that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuh? What are you talking about? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go and act like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the boss of me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d snapped Ibuki.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you even stoop to using chicks as soldiers, huh, Ryuuen?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCould say the same to you, buddy. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the one who brought that cute little thing over there, right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Just like how Ryuuen was accompanied by Ibuki, Housen had Nanase standing beside him.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mine. Well, whatever, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care less about that. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have some fun, Ryuuen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlready told ya. Hard pass.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">No matter how many times Housen tried to provoke Ryuuen into fighting, Ryuuen wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t budge. As if to signal his disinterest, Ryuuen turned his back on Housen, showing that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d made his mind up about withdrawing.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuh, that so? In that case\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Housen must have decided Ryuuen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to take the bait was no fun, because he suddenly extended his arm in a smooth, casual movement. He reached out for Ibuki. She tried to brush him off.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">However\\xe2\\x80\\xa6</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Just as she tried to brush him off, he quickly accelerated the force behind the movement, grabbing Ibuki by the neck and raising her up into the air. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNgh?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ibuki hurriedly tried to free herself from his grip, as if a distress signal were being transmitted from her brain to the rest of her body in that instant. However, Housen merely flashed an audacious grin, not giving an inch, as if his arms were made of steel. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ryuuen turned back around and saw Ibuki being choked out by Housen. She tried to break free of his grip, deftly using her arms and legs, but Housen still didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t budge. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHah. Just try and slip outta that. Or, all of you watchin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 can jump in and get a piece of me too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Judging by the look on Housen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that he was fearless\\xe2\\x80\\x94but rather, that he possessed a kind of absolute confidence. However, I was certain this wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the kind of situation where I could step into the ring myself. If I made a scene right here and now, the school would naturally get wind of it and inevitably show up to put a stop to the situation. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The only one who wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tied down by such concerns\\xe2\\x80\\x94Ryuuen\\xe2\\x80\\x94was the one who made a move, though he looked rather exasperated about it. Probably moving to save Ibuki rather than strike a blow against Housen, he moved forward, slipping into the space between Ibuki and Housen, near his chest. However, Housen still kept his grip tight on Ibuki\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neck. And even in this situation, where his movement was limited, he continued to sidestep Ryuuen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s repeated kicks. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsshole!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Ishizaki.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ishizaki, who had been told to stand down before, now jumped into the fray. A commotion was starting to erupt, the likes of which you could never imagine happening in the hallways here at school.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, yeah! Man, am I glad I came all the way to this school,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">A genuine, no-holds-barred fight might actually start any second now. Amid all this, Nanase, who had been watching the situation from the onset, opened her mouth to speak.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease stop, Housen-kun.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Despite the handicap of still having Ibuki in his grasp, Housen looked ready to start brawling with Ryuuen and Ishizaki as they barreled down on him. But he stopped moving after his classmate Nanase called out to him.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99d you just say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Rather than heed her warning, he looked irritated by the fact that she had spoken up and butted in.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe upperclassmen have all been concerned about the fact that there are surveillance cameras around here for a while now. Judging from the situation, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve determined there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing to be gained by getting violent here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nanase.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, I </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">know</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">. I know already, I was just messin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 around with \\xe2\\x80\\x99em,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen, before adding that he knew all along that we second-years were tied down because of the surveillance cameras.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If that was the case, everything Housen had just done after showing up here really was quite puzzling. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">He ignored Nanase\\xe2\\x80\\x99s warning, looking as though he was about to resume fighting, so she spoke up once more, in a firmer tone than before.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you do understand, then that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all the more reason you should stop. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to try to waste more time here, then I have an idea of my own. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m considering bringing </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">that</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> up and telling everyone here about it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nanase.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">After Housen heard her mention </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">that</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">, whatever abstract idea it was supposed to represent, he stopped moving once again. Then, with a look of total boredom on his face, he let go of Ibuki and dropped her to the floor, where she coughed and hacked. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey, not bad, Nanase. But just know that if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live up to my expectations, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show you any mercy. Even if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a girl. Got it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen that time comes, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take whatever comes my way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nanase.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even though Housen had just threatened her, Nanase didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sound upset. She seemed so calm that it was like it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter one bit to her that she was currently standing on the second-years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 floor. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even so, this Housen guy was certainly no pushover. There was no shortage of people in my grade level who could boast of their fighting prowess. Among the guys, that included Ryuuen, Sudou, and Albert. Even though Housen was a first-year, just this brief glimpse of him in action told me he was quite capable himself. He probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the kind of opponent I could subdue all that easily, if I were to face off against him. And because I </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">had </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">only gotten a glimpse of him in action, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t predict how things would go if he really went all out. Ryuuen had probably tried to stop Ishizaki from casually throwing down against Housen because he determined that engaging in a simple fistfight would put them at a disadvantage. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">This was one hell of a new student we were dealing with.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stop. My business is all taken care of. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go, Nanase,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a wise choice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Nanase.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Housen, seemingly satisfied with everything else except for the lack of a fight, shot one last look at Ryuuen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you get down on your knees for me, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind pairin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up with ya. Whaddya say, Ryuuen-paisen?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSorry, dude, but I only work with human beings. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say I got any plans of teamin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up with a wild gorilla.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, well, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">However, this whole ordeal wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t over yet. Aside from Housen and Nanase, there was one other first-year present who had been observing the entire situation. Perhaps Housen was upset with this other student, because he turned his attention to him at the end.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey, you just gonna hide and watch, punk?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you know the proverb \\xe2\\x80\\x98a wide man keeps away from danger\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied the student, fending off Housen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s glare with an eloquent response. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaking friendly conversation is fine, but it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be beneficial for you to cause a ruckus here, Housen-kun. At any rate, I think you ought to withdraw for the time being. Am I wrong?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">At the same time, the boy gave Housen what could be interpreted as friendly advice, an adult showed, too.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are you doing, Housen?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">This lone man, clad in a suit, seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, as if to put a stop to all this tumultuous situation. Many of the second-years who had been standing by and watching the situation unfold had fled, returning to their own classrooms.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHousen, I understand you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re restless. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also quite sure the school rules have been drilled so thoroughly into your head by now that it feels ready to explode,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the adult.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, yeah, I know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you do understand, then hurry up and disperse. No\\xc2\\xa0fighting in the hallways.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was hardly even a real fight, though,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d snorted Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">With a scornful chuckle, he thrust his hands into his pockets, and then turned around, making an unexpectedly easy decision to retreat. He then ordered Nanase to retreat as well.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, see you later, Horikita.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Housen purposefully dropped Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name before he left\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Well, no. It might be more accurate to say he was addressing the whole of Class 2-D. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe apologize for the disturbance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nanase, with a bow of her head.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">With that apology, the situation seemed to have been more or less successfully contained. But, when Nanase lifted her head back up, she looked me right in the eyes right as she was leaving. It was the same look she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d given me when she first arrived on this floor. A probing look, almost as if she wanted to know something. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">However, as soon as I noticed her looking at me, she immediately averted her eyes, and chased after Housen.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must apologize to you all. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m terribly sorry. My students have caused you quite a bit of trouble,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the teacher apologized to Horikita as she stood by watching everything that happened.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here, please allow me to briefly introduce myself. I am Shiba Katsunori and I will be overseeing Class 1-D. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only just accepted a position here at this school. I look forward to getting to know you all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the teacher.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">After giving us that brief self-introduction, Shiba-sensei left, following at Housen. Then, almost as if they were taking turns, the level-headed boy from earlier came up and bowed his head to us. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would seem that my classmate Housen-kun has caused a great deal of trouble for you, our seniors. On behalf of the first-year students, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to offer my humble apologies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the boy.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Unlike Housen, he seemed to be quite a well-spoken student.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe first-year students still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand these special exams very well. I apologize for the inconvenience this may cause you, but we would humbly appreciate any help. Thank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the student.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">After he had finished giving us his apologies and general salutations, the student, who was apparently named Yagami, looked as though he was about to leave himself. But then he seemed to notice something\\xe2\\x80\\x94a group of four girls from Class D who\\xe2\\x80\\x99d just returned from lunch. Matsushita, Kushida, Satou, and Mii-chan. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Yagami looked at one member of the group, Kushida, with surprise on his face.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been quite a fuss. What happened, Horikita-san?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Though Kushida was clearly aware of Yagami\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence in turn, she asked Horikita about what was going on, sounding quite curious. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing that you all need to worry about,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, really?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">After Horikita told them that it was nothing, Kushida and the other three girls started to head back towards the classroom.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUm, pardon me, but\\xe2\\x80\\xa6you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen to be Kushida-senpai, by any chance, would you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Yagami.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHm?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Kushida, turning around to look at who\\xe2\\x80\\x99d addressed her. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If he knew Kushida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name, could he be an acquaintance of hers? Or so I thought, but\\xe2\\x80\\xa6</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUm, you are?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kushida.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She gave him a puzzled look. There was no sign that she was familiar with him.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s me. Do you not recognize me? Well, I suppose that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only natural that you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Yagami Takuya,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Kushida thought on it for a while after hearing his name, but then seemed to suddenly remember. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYagami\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Ah! Wait! You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">that</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> Yagami-kun?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I am most certainly that Yagami. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been quite a long time, hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWow, so you came to this school too, Yagami-kun. What an incredible coincidence!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never imagined I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d meet you again here, Kushida-senpai.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know each other?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Satou, curiously.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Kushida nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. But we hardly ever actually talked before. Anyway, his name is Yagami Takuya-kun. He always seemed incredibly smart. but since we were in different grades, we never said much more than hello to each other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, do you know him too?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I asked, whispering in Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ear to get confirmation.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNope, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know him at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied immediately.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem very good at remembering the faces of your classmates, though.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deny that. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly have time to pay attention to people I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interested in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Apparently, Horikita didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize\\xe2\\x80\\xa6no, it was more like he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t register in her mind at all. I supposed if you were the kind of person who treated your classmates that way, there was no way you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d remember students younger than you. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, even if Kushida didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember this boy, </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">probably never been able to forget her. It just went to show how captivating she was.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe how lucky I am. To be able to go to the same school as the revered Kushida-senpai\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Yagami.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, no, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit much, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m nothing special\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied humbly.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">However, if Yagami really had attended the same junior high as Kushida, then a few concerns came to mind. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes this Yagami kid know about </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">you know what</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I\\xc2\\xa0whispered to Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I was referring to Kushida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s past, of course. In junior high, Kushida had caused her own class to turn on itself and fall apart. As a result, she considered Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x94who\\xe2\\x80\\x99d attended the same school back then and knew the truth about what happened\\xe2\\x80\\x94a bitter enemy. Kushida wanted to get rid of Horikita, considering it too dangerous for someone to know what she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d done to her class. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If Yagami had attended the same junior high, it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a surprise if he knew about what happened, too, but\\xe2\\x80\\xa6</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be strange if he did. That being said, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no guarantee that he does,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In that case, Yagami being here certainly wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very comforting for Kushida. Since there were students in our grade level who\\xe2\\x80\\x99d attended the same schools before, I supposed it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t out of the question for students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 former juniors to enroll, either. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI realize this is quite sudden, but I must say I would have neither complaints nor concerns if I were able to team up with someone like you, Kushida-senpai. Would you be willing to partner with me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Yagami.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even though he and Kushida had only just been reunited, he asked to become partners, extending his hand with a friendly smile on his face. Was this all to show that he knew nothing about her past? Or that even if he did know, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter?</span></p>\\n<div style=\"page-break-after: always;\"/>\\n<section epub:type=\"frontmatter titlepage\">\\n    <img alt=\"Front Image1\" class=\"insert\" src=\"../Images/INTERIORIMAGES_3.jpg\"/>\\n  </section>\\n<div style=\"page-break-after: always;\"/>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting__And__Page_Break\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you really okay with partnering with me, though? I mean, Yagami-kun, perhaps it would be better if you partnered with someone more on your level academically?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kushida.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Yagami Takuya had an extremely high academic ability rating of A. Nothing to scoff at. No wonder Kushida was being so humble. Horikita, who had her phone out, looked up his information in the OAA app while she stood next to me, and confirmed that he was high-ranked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know my way around here at all. So, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to partner with someone I trust,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Yagami.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The app could give you an idea of a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic ability, but not their nature. He must have decided it would be better to team up with an acquaintance who he could be sure would produce solid results.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUm, well, could you give me some time to think it over\\xe2\\x80\\xa6?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Perhaps because she was wary of Yagami, or for some other reason, Kushida put his offer on hold for the time being.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, that would be perfectly fine. I will hold off on partnering up with anyone else for a while, and await your reply, Kushida-senpai.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yagami agreed to put the offer on hold, indicating he was fine to wait. Considering that his academic ability was A-rank, there was no need for him to rush out and find a partner. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDamn, that must be nice. If it were me, I would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve partnered up without a second thought\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sudou seemed jealous of Kushida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to put an offer on hold. That made sense, considering his ranking was only E+.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn that case, you should work harder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll definitely improve my scores,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a mean-spirited comment. Sudou was envious because he had a desire to improve himself. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I distanced myself from Horikita and the others for a moment because I saw Haruka beckoning me to come over. The rest of Ayanokouji Group all stood a short distance away: Akito, Keisei, and Airi. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH-he was super scary, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The first thing I heard after joining them was Airi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first impression of Housen. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure seems there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bunch of troublemakers like Sudou-kun</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\"> </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">and Ryuuen-kun</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\"> </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">in this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s batch of new students, huh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Haruka sounded somewhat exasperated after having watched the entire commotion play out.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Standing beside her was Akito. He remained motionless, staring fixedly at the spot in the hall where Housen once stood.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the matter, Miyacchi?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Haruka.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA seriously scary dude has come to our school. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just say things are probably gonna get rocky from here on out. That dude\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so tough that even Sudou or Ryuuen can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take him on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Akito.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait, hold up. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell me you know this guy too, Miyachi. Do you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Haruka.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never, like, met him in person or anythin\\xe2\\x80\\x99. But Ryuuen and Housen are both pretty big celebrities back where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m from,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Akito.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It seemed Akito had lived somewhere close to the junior high schools that Ryuuen and Housen had attended.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyway, there used to be this gang leader at my school\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The short version of the story is that this guy was a really tough-looking badass who was supposed to be really good in a fight. But one day, he just suddenly vanished. It caused a huge uproar. Then, right after he disappeared, I heard he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d wound up in the hospital after getting the crap beaten out of him in a one-on-one fight with some dude named Housen, who was on a rampage. This Housen had apparently just started at our junior high. He was a whole two years younger than the other\\xc2\\xa0guy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cG-gang leader? Dang, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like somethin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 straight out of a manga about bad dudes\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little scary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Haruka.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe place I used to live in has been pretty infamous for attracting all sorts of riff raff for a long time now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Akito. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, wow\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Haruka looked a little bit perplexed to hear this string of unfamiliar words from Akito.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd just like that, Housen went around all the junior high schools in the area, one after another, tightening his grip on all of \\xe2\\x80\\x99em,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Akito.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRyuuen-kun\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty infamous too, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he? But it seems like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never met before,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Haruka.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI get the feeling that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x99cause they just never happened to run into each other,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Akito.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, did you used to be a bad dude yourself, Miyachi?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Haruka.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I quit doing that kinda stuff. These days I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m tryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to be a proper student.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, you </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">were</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> a delinquent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I had a bad temper all the way up into my second-year of junior high. Since then, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve focused everything into archery,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Akito.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut that means you really used to be a bad kid, though, right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Haruka.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Akito scratched his head in annoyance as Haruka, strangely enough, continued to press the matter.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong with that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shot back.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, actually, like\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kinda fine? If anything, I think that means you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a pretty cool past. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ya think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Haruka.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cool at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Akito.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I was guessing the reason he knew so much about fighting was because he used to be that sort of person. You could certainly tell by looking at him that he had nerves of steel and quick reflexes.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean, since you were a former bad kid yourself, couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you just give Housen a taste of his own medicine if necessary?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Haruka.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuit jokin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 around. Even if I do fight somebody, I choose my opponents carefully. And I especially wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wanna fight Housen, for sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Akito.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Akito was raising the white flag before the fight even happened. He was saying that less as an admission of his own weakness, though, and more due to recognizing Housen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strength. Ibuki also had a certain degree of proficiency when it came to hand-to-hand combat, and she hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to land a single hit. There was just an overwhelming difference in their physiques. And she wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a match for him when it came to speed either.</span></p>\\n<div style=\"page-break-after: always;\"/>\\n<p class=\"P_TEXTBODY_CENTERALIGN_PAGEBREAK\"><span><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.27em;\">4.3</span></span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\">\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.40em;\">A</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.80em;\">FTER CLASS ENDED</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.80em;\">,</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> I was approached by Horikita, just like yesterday. As we were about to leave the classroom together, Sudou insisted on accompanying us as well. Horikita tried to refuse him, but just like last time, she seemed to be won over by his eagerness to help until he found a partner of his own. She let him come along on the condition that him taking time to help her wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interfere with his club activities or his studies. It was certainly surprising for Horikita to be so kind, or perhaps I should say accepting.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But I supposed there was a good reason for her allowing him to come. There were about ten days left until the special exam. Considering how exceptionally difficult the written exam was going to be, it was a good idea to secure a time and place where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be able to concentrate on your studies, even if just for a little while. But if Sudou was constantly worrying about what Horikita was up to, he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to concentrate. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It was clear to see that Horikita wanted to find a partner for Sudou as soon as possible, so that he could have time to devote himself to his studies. Horikita understood Sudou Ken very well\\xe2\\x80\\x94except for one particularly important thing. Namely, Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings for Horikita. She hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognized that there was a reason, deep down, why he just wanted to be by her side.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Of course, I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to deliberately point out what was an important driving force for Sudou. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Instead of heading toward the first-year classrooms, Horikita decided to head towards Keyaki Mall, perhaps because some first-years had caused quite a bit of trouble after coming up to our floor today during lunch. She was being careful to ensure a comparable incident didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take\\xc2\\xa0place.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Or maybe it was the problem child Housen, from Class 1-D, who had caused Horikita to change her mind. I supposed we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d find out soon enough. As soon as we entered the mall, Sudou stuck the little finger of his left hand in his ear to try and block out some of the sound, seeming a little irritated by the noise. He then gave his honest thoughts on the new students we saw out and about in front of us.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMan, I gotta say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loud in here, dude. Guess that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x99cause of the first-years kickin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up a ruckus and all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere certainly are quite a lot of students around,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">They were all over the place, chatting away happily, discussing things like what they wanted to buy or what they wanted to eat.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all seriously lookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for partners over here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d huffed Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Wasting day after day trying to decide on a partner wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t good for either the second-years or the first-years. However, there was one particularly huge point of separation between the first- and second-years. That was the difference in our perception of the special exams. Very few of the new students felt a keen sense of urgency, just like the ones we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d seen yesterday after class. This fact was even more apparent when we set foot outside the school building.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no wonder. I mean, it was the same for us, back when we were the new kids,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">With the hefty sum of money deposited into their accounts right after they had enrolled here, the new students were spending day after day in pursuit of idle amusement. Even if they were in Class A, it hardly made a difference. Regardless of how they were using their points, the fact was that they were all enjoying what this school had to offer to the absolute fullest. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The most annoying thing of all, though, was the fact that there was a difference in the penalties we faced and the ones the new students did. We faced expulsion, while all they stood to lose were three months\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of Private Points. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at \\xe2\\x80\\x99em, not a care in the world, man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be talking if I were you, Sudou-kun. Have you forgotten what you were like a year ago?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cN-no, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget or anythin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a lot of soul searchin\\xe2\\x80\\x99,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Probably because he was the first student in our class to be faced with the real threat of being expelled. The relief measure that we had utilized at the time was no longer available to us, of course. The privilege of being beginners had already been used up.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the time being, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s try talking with a group of people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita, spotting a group of three first-year guys sitting on a bench, chatting and laughing among themselves.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Their names were Kaga, Mikami, and Shiratori. They were all students in Class 1-D and all had an academic ability ranking of B- or better. Before calling out to these students, Horikita had pulled up their information in the app, just to be sure. It seemed she hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed her mind about going after students from Class 1-D, after all.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, do you have a moment?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6What is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied one of the students.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">They could probably tell just by glancing at us that they were dealing with upperclassmen. The joyful expressions quietly faded from their faces and were quickly replaced with looks of caution. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for partners for the upcoming special exam. Have you found partners yourselves yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, uh, no. We still haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t partnered up with anyone yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the students.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be happy to talk to you about partnering up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d definitely be okay with that. Right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the students.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">After hearing Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal, the three of them nodded in response, almost as if they had discussed matters in advance. We got an unexpectedly good vibe from their response, and it seemed like they had relaxed their guard a little bit. Sudou looked surprised, like he could hardly believe how positive they were acting.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowever, while I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very sorry to say this, our top priority right now is to find\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPartners who can help out the students with poor grades to prevent them from being expelled, right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the students, finishing Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sentence.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It seemed that idea had already spread among the new students.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. If you understand that already, then this discussion will be quick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUm, well\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 so, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 one of us to team up with Sudou-senpai?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked one of the students.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d also checked out our profiles on their phones, which was why they had no hesitation in talking with us.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the students we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to find a partner for. There are many others, as well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, okay, I see. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see, Sudou-senpai has an academic ability ranking of E+, huh\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 That does sound quite difficult,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the student.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">He was being diplomatic, but it was still clear he was pointing out just how low Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic ability ranking was. Even though what he said was true, Sudou seemed upset. Still, he barely managed to keep it together and not let his dissatisfaction show on his face.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShiratori, you should be able to handle it just fine, right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The other two students looked to Shiratori, who sat at the far-right end of the bench.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy academic ability ranking is A, at least for the time being,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, so it seems. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re willing to partner with him, I would certainly not complain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn that case\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 how about this much?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Shiratori held out his hand with all five fingers up, making a proposal in return.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">For a moment, Horikita didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand what he was suggesting, so she looked back at Sudou and me.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy oh my. You want to partner up, right? If so, I should think something like this would be obvious. No?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When Horikita heard that, she understood what he meant. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I suppose you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re referring to Private Points.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course. I mean, if someone like myself were to team up with a smart student, I could shoot for the top spot. Since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be giving up a chance at getting the top-tier rewards by partnering with a student with a low academic ranking, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only natural that I ask for something in return,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay what? You want points from us?! And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re askin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for fifty thousand\\xe2\\x80\\xa6? Dude, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way too much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">For someone like Sudou, who was constantly short on funds every day, that was an extraordinary number of points to ask for.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSenpai, please stop joking around. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way I could accept fifty-thousand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI meant five hundred thousand. If you can give me five hundred thousand, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll happily partner up with you right here and now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cF-five hundred thousand?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">quite</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> difficult for you if a student got expelled from your class, right? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing a bit of research ourselves, you see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Apparently, this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s batch of new students were quite different from how we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been last year. They had already begun to understand how this school worked, and on top of that, they understood their value. Between our grade level and theirs, it was difficult to tell which of us were the seniors and which the juniors. Looking at the situation we were in, it could easily be interpreted the other way around.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certainly natural to want some kind of remuneration if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being asked to partner with someone with a low academic ability ranking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH-hey, Suzune! I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got five hundred large though, y\\xe2\\x80\\x99know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know that. Be quiet for a minute,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The three first-year students wore sarcastic, wry smiles on their faces after hearing Sudou carelessly divulge his financial circumstances. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only natural to want points, yes. However, is chasing after short-term desires really a good idea?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeaning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Shiratori, speaking as a representative of the three students.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeaning that if you ingratiate yourselves with us here and now, we might be able to provide help to you down the road, in similar situations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita, explaining to them that it would be to their advantage later if they were to exchange in some give-and-take with us in a form other than Private Points.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, putting you aside, Horikita-senpai, since you have an A ranking, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really imagine having Sudou-senpai or Ayanokouji-senpai there would really be of any help to us. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not necessarily true. This school isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just about academics. There are times when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need physical ability, too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That was especially applicable to Sudou, as he was the only student in our grade level who had an A+ in physical ability. Horikita had been intending to use that as a weapon in her arsenal for this negotiation, but\\xe2\\x80\\xa6</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know that. But still, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Class D</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> in the end, right? If we were to ingratiate ourselves within anyone, it would be Class A or Class B,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori calmly, having apparently come to an objective conclusion.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Seeing that, Horikita probably understood. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I see. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Considering how smoothly they handled themselves after hearing our offer and the number of points they came back with as a counter-offer, we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to think too hard about what was going on here.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWh-what do you mean by that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBefore you arrived, we were approached by senior students from other classes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd they told you not to sell your academic abilities for cheap. Right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. Please understand that we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t partner with you if you do not offer us suitable compensation in points,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In the face of Shiratori and his classmates, Horikita kept her composure, and then continued talking.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certainly true that you shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sell yourself cheaply, in that case. However, were you </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">really</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> approached by other students from our grade, though?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Shiratori. He looked irritated, like his pride as an A-ranked student had been wounded.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also in Class D, just like us. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t imagine students from higher-level classes would have approached you so casually,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita was bluffing. As long as you had an elevated level of academic ability, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be useful to have around in this exam, regardless of whether you were in Class D. She was trying to confirm who had talked to them, and how much they had said. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Perhaps because Shiratori\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pride had been called into question, he rebutted this in a somewhat abrasive tone.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, though. We were invited by Hashimoto-senpai from Class 2-A. On top of that, we were approached by students from Class 2-C, who offered us quite a few points to partner up with them. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori, glancing at his friends, who both immediately voiced their agreement.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not the only ones, either. Most of the smart kids have been approached,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Just as Horikita had calculated, Class 2-A and Class C had gone with the idea of trying to buy students out.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 In that case, I suppose we cannot meet your expectations right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, but as long as you give us points, we will not refuse you. We intend to see how things go for about a week. If you were to offer us five hundred thousand points during that time, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be happy to partner with anyone, even Sudou-senpai,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Five hundred thousand points to prevent someone from getting expelled. A large sum to be sure, but if you looked at it from another angle, you could say it was the price of your safety. However, we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a snap decision here. Nor did we intend to.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 How many points did Hashimoto-kun and the others offer you for your cooperation?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She was hoping to know the specific number of points that were offered, but Shiratori and his buddies weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that na\\xc3\\xafve. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe promised not to say. All I will say is that for five hundred thousand points, we will help you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI understand. I will take that into consideration. However, we would like to ask you for one favor. Would you be willing to introduce us to some of your fellow students in Class D?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIntroduce?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Shiratori repeated.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already prepared to work with your class, to a certain extent. But approaching each person individually and explaining the same thing over and over would take up a lot of time and energy. If possible, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to gather all of you in one place and have a more concrete discussion then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She had hinted at the idea of forming a partnership, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say specifically what that would look like. The three students exchanged glances, though they all looked uncomfortable about something.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Well, asking us to do something like that might be a little </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">difficult</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Right, guys?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah. If we go ahead and do something like that\\xc2\\xa0without getting permission, Housen-kun will probably get mad at us. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The name \\xe2\\x80\\x98Housen\\xe2\\x80\\x99 came up in the conversation they were having among themselves.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry senpai, but could you please ask someone else to handle that\\xe2\\x80\\xa6?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It seemed Housen was the one who held Class 1-D\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leashes, after all. Horikita, sensing that the mood had clearly changed, decided not to pursue the matter further. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you. I will call on you again if the need arises,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\xc2\\xa0said.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA-all right. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be waiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shiratori.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">We walked away from the bench and started heading towards the caf\\xc3\\xa9 on the second floor. I secretly peeked back at them as we left, and saw that Shiratori, phone in hand, seemed to be hurriedly calling someone.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe got some information, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to say that we made any actual progress. The only thing we know for sure is that if we were to offer them an absolutely absurd five hundred thousand points, they would agree to cooperate with us on the spot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re totally tryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to take advantage of us and price gouge, makin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 those ridiculous demands,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d huffed Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt certainly is a ridiculous amount they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asking for, yes. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also true that they have no reason to sell their talents on the cheap,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even more so if they were ranked A in academic ability. This was certainly a much more direct way of earning points than shooting for the one-hundred-thousand-point reward for getting high marks on the exam.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo in the end, the only way for me to save myself is by payin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 somebody a bunch of Private Points?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certainly getting harder and harder to say for sure that there are any students out there who will help you for free.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The notion that points would be the key to forming partnerships had already spread. It would be best if we assumed it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just Shiratori and his friends who believed so, but rather that their entire grade level knew to ask for points in exchange for partnerships. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I was sure we could safely say this was part of Sakayanagi and Ryuuen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategy, too. Normally, doing things in exchange for points was frowned upon. Such transactions brought with them a sense of shame, and so, they were usually done in secret. But by conducting a large-scale buy out operation, they had essentially made the new students realize that offering their services for free would be losing out. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even so, there was something that bothered me about the conversation we just had with Shiratori and his classmates earlier. Though they had already been approached by students from other classes, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d said that they were going to wait a week. Even if they were just waiting that long so they could try and fish for more points, I was concerned by the fact that all three of them had seemed to be in agreement about their course of action from the very beginning. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I would have thought students would have wanted to seek reassurance by finding a partner right away. Was it just that those particular three happened to be bullheaded? Or perhaps\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven if we continue to ask around randomly like this, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably keep getting the same answers, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I told them.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Scoping out Class 1-D was fun and all, but the real problem came after that. What Shiratori and his friends said about Housen getting angry with them if they acted without permission stuck in my mind. Judging from the way Shiratori and his friends talked, I was certain that Housen Kazuomi oversaw their entire class. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHousen likely gave his classmates some instructions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe probably told them something like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hey, you can team up with anybody you want, but you can </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">only</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> make a snap decision to team up if they offer you five hundred thousand points. If they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make that offer, put their request to team up on hold, even if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re from Class A,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or something like that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut wait, if they do that, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that mean Class 1-D gets left behind?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re planning on that happening. They intend to be the last ones,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuh? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only we second-year students who are afraid of getting hit with the penalty for not finding a partner. He was probably thinking that he can hold that over our heads and use it to rip us off for as many Private Points as possible toward the end,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I told him.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If all the honors students outside of Class 1-D had already been bought up, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d eventually have no choice but to shell out to get the ones from Class D to cooperate with us, whether we liked it or not. Even if that meant paying a million or two million.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incredibly rash strategy, made with absolutely no thought about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll happen in the future,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell me again, how exactly do you plan on fighting this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d already figured out what Class 1-D was planning to do. So, having taken that into account, I wanted to know what Horikita was thinking. Would she try and force herself in between what Class 2-A and Class C were starting to do right now, with their extreme buy-out strategies? Or would she perhaps adopt a strategy more like what Ichinose was doing, forming relationships built on trust by accepting many lower-ranked students, regardless of what class they were in, and appealing to the honors students for their cooperation?</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI decided to set three goals when we heard the outline for this particular special exam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree goals?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">He seemed to be interested in what she was about to say, since he was leaning in closer.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe most important of which is to not let anyone from our class get expelled. That goes without saying,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, for sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Sudou, nodding.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe second is to shoot for third place or better in overall points, in the competition against other classes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait, third? You mean we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re throwin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 away our shot of going after first or second right from the get-go?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo one said anything about throwing away our shot of going after those places. I said third place or better,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">True enough, saying she was hoping for third place or better technically included first- and second-place. But that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to be precisely what she meant, and it most likely had something to do with her third goal.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy third goal is to avoid participating in these money games. I plan to do battle with those three principles in mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuh\\xe2\\x80\\xa6? B-but\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stammered Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI understand what you want to say. Namely, that if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to compete using Private Points, then we have no hope of winning this thing. However, even if we try and compete using the points that we have, the reward isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worth the risk. Even if we do finish in first place overall, we will only gain fifty Class Points. Meaning that over the course of a year, our class would only get a little over two million Private Points,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If we got five thousand points per person per month, (excluding the deposit that we got in April, which had already passed) and multiplied that amount by the remaining eleven months, then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d end up with two million, one hundred and forty-five thousand Private Points.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if we pay five hundred thousand points per person, that means we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be in the red after paying for five people. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possibly be so na\\xc3\\xafve as to think that we could win this thing just by getting four or so first-years who have an academic ability ranking of A, right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even if we were to carry that into the next two years\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, until we graduated\\xe2\\x80\\x94it would still only be four million, four hundred and eighty-five thousand Private Points. Which covered a maximum of eight recruits. Moreover, this was all based on the supposition that not only could we assuredly draw in those students at five hundred thousand at most, but also, that we would be getting first place in the overall rankings by grade level. Considering the risks, it would likely be far more efficient for us to simply wait for an upcoming special exam and use our Private Points then.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrivate Points and Class Points are not equal. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m well aware that there is more to it than just what we get in return. However, I think that even if we do pump all our points into this test, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d only have a slim chance of winning, so we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try and push it. Am I wrong, Ayanokouji-kun?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all. Your decision is the right one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The difference in overall academic ability between us and Class 2-A had been clear from the start. If we wanted to win overall, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really imagine we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d gain much of an advantage from bringing in eight students. Of course, Horikita was resourceful. She would probably consider paying out Private Points if there were students who were willing to partner up for fifty or a hundred thousand. It was just that she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want this battle to come down to what was in our bank accounts.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn order to achieve those three goals, I still think we should try to negotiate with Class 1-D, after all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWh-why though? Weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all the kids in their class told by Housen not to team up with us for anythin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 less than five hundred large?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs far as the honors students are concerned, yes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. However, there are students in their class who have an academic ability ranking of C or below, too. What do you think would happen if they were neglected?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat would happen\\xe2\\x80\\xa6?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStudents who should normally have been fine would also receive penalties, and their position would be thrown into question,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita nodded at what I said, and then continued from there.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way those students would willingly give up the Private Points they could get every month. Which means at some point, Housen-kun will have no choice but to abandon his current stance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even if all the honors students in 1-D tried selling themselves for five hundred thousand points, the rest of the students in their class couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do the same. Putting aside the issue of whether second-year students would get expelled or not, Housen would fall behind in the battle between the first-years.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s looking for a way to win, there will definitely be an opening that we can exploit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It seemed she was intent on dealing with Class 1-D then, the class that everyone else wanted to avoid.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat being said, it would be dangerous for all thirty-nine of us to try and engage with Housen-kun\\xe2\\x80\\x99s class. We need to minimize the risk as much as possible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If our negotiations failed, then it would be the students with less academic skill who would be in trouble.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cConsidering that the exam period has only just begun, I suppose it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not strange some kids are asking for entirely unreasonable conditions to partner up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I hope you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I mean, as far as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m concerned though, I kinda doubt there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anyone out there for me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn any case, the only way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find gifted partners is to reach out to a lot of people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">As we were waking up the steps to the caf\\xc3\\xa9 on the second floor though, we heard a voice come from behind us.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey! If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a gifted partner, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m right here, y\\xe2\\x80\\x99know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When we turned around, we saw a lone female student looking over at us, with a big grin on her face, from ear to ear. As soon as our eyes met, she slowly walked up the steps. Horikita was the first one of us to let her suspicions show on her face.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWere you eavesdropping on us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, gosh, no, senpai, I just shouted out because I only happened to hear what you were saying is all. And umm\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The girl spoke without looking over at Sudou or me, keeping her gaze locked onto Horikita. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSenpai, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your name and academic ability ranking?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 My name\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Horikita. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m from Class 2-D. My academic ability score is A-. What of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, wow, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re smart!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied the girl.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd your name is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Ichika Amasawa. From Class 1-A. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the same as you, Horikita-senpai. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got an A in academic ability.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">She looks like a girl who only cares about popularity, but is actually quite a smart student.</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> Just to be sure, Horikita checked her information in the app.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you want to shoot for the top, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll work with you. Okay?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Amasawa asked that question without even asking anything about our backgrounds. If students with A- and A ratings teamed up together, it certainly wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be impossible for them to get first place. As for Horikita, she had deliberately lowered her score for Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake in the past, so if you took that fact into consideration, it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be unfair to say she actually was an A, not an A-.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Though this was unexpected, Horikita could very well end up settling on a partner for herself, not Sudou or anyone else. This might be a coincidence, but a student with an academic ability ranking of A </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">did</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> just reach out to her. If Horikita were to say that she instead wanted Amasawa to partner with a student with a lower ranking, Amasawa might choose to walk away.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI sincerely appreciate the offer, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually not looking for a partner right now myself. Instead of partnering with me though, could I possibly ask you about partnering with him\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 With Sudou-kun?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita took that risk anyway, introducing the girl to Sudou. Though Sudou was a little perplexed by the situation, he gently bowed his head to Amasawa, giving her a proper greeting.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUh, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sudou-senpai\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic ability ranking?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cE+. Certainly not a good grade, by any stretch,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x98Not good\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was putting it mildly. If anything, he was in the running for the lowest ranking in our entire grade.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI gotcha. So that means you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for help, Horikita-senpai. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to find a partner for him so that he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get kicked out of school.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amasawa, having grasped the situation, looked over at Sudou. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cE+, huh. If we teamed up, forget about getting the top spot. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d probably end up scoring a little under the middle of the road.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hardly any advantage for you in it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I wondered if Amasawa was going to bring up points now, but there was no sign she was going to do that.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, still, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re askin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for help, I certainly wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind lending you a hand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Things were clearly looking much more favorable for us than how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d gone with those three boys earlier. Amasawa then looked in my direction.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about him? Is he looking for a partner too?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis academic ability ranking is C. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not exactly a top priority for us. However, if Sudou-kun is a no-go for you, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d still be very appreciative if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d team up with Ayanokouji-kun, as a worst-case scenario,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait, no, hold on\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied, cutting in.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">While this was probably a kind gesture on Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part, I had to put a stop to it. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just decide upon a partner right now without thinking about it.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs there something wrong with her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like that, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, hey, wait a sec. I still haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t said which one of them I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pair up with yet though, y\\xe2\\x80\\x99know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amasawa, seeing that the conversation was moving ahead without her actual consent on the matter, spoke up and put a stop to it.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you have any conditions you would need fulfilled for you to partner with either of these two, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cConditions, conditions, huh. Yeah, okay. I suppose I am entitled to at least that much, right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita had decided to bring up the topic herself, to see if Amasawa had any conditions for a partnership. She hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed her basic policy of avoiding engaging in a spending competition with the other classes using Private Points, but if Amasawa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price was low enough, there was room for consideration. I just prayed it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too high a price, like what Shiratori and his friends were asking for\\xe2\\x80\\xa6</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I really like strong people, y\\xe2\\x80\\x99know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa, saying something that had absolutely nothing to do with this exam while wearing a devilish little grin.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat in the world are you talking about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Horikita furrowed her brow suspiciously, having expected the topic of discussion to shift from studies to points.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, I was racking my brain over what I should do for this exam and stuff. I was thinking, should I study super hard, team up with someone around A-rank like Horikita-senpai, and try and shoot for the top? \\xe2\\x80\\xa6Or, like, should I kinda take it easy, just try and get through the exam? And if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to take it easy in the test, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d wanna team up with someone I like, you know what I mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I supposed that was certainly preferable to working with someone you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like or someone you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about at all.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like strong guys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Amasawa, repeating what she had just said earlier. Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head spun as she tried to understand what Amasawa was saying.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeaning\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asking if Sudou-kun is strong or not, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not talking about, like, being mentally strong or anything. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m asking about whether he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s physically strong. Well, I can tell easily enough that you do sports or stuff just from looking at your physique,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa, pointing her finger at Sudou, a student who normally should be a non-entity to someone with an A in academic ability.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Sudou was confident of his strength, so while he was somewhat shy about it, he nodded in agreement.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou wanna partner with me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Amasawa, extending her hand and caressing Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheek.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cW-well, I mean, if I had an A in academics, then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be a lot better off though\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Are you really okay with me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you really are strong, then sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She ran her thin fingertip along Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chest, mesmerizing him with her allure.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI-I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m strong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">dislike</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> guys who are full of confidence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat exactly do you mean, if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really strong?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Horikita, who had taken on the responsibility of getting Sudou situated, expressed her lack of understanding of what Amasawa was talking about.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt means what it sounds like. I like strong people who are good in a fight.

I can vouch for his physical strength,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWords aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough for me, though. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to confirm it with my own eyes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6With your own eyes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean like, go out, round up a bunch of strong second-years, have \\xe2\\x80\\x99em fight each other.

There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way we could do something like that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy not? Hey, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been serious this whole time we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been talking, right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Sudou, who couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe Amasawa was being serious either, spoke. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go, Suzune. Stayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a waste of time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It sounded almost as though he was admonishing himself for falling for Amasawa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charms, even if only for a moment.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEh, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really care if you just wanna pretend this conversation never happened,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She was saying that to her, this whole thing was nothing more than a little fun. She certainly didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to go out of her way to partner up with an E+ ranked student, if she wanted. Considering the fact that Amasawa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s class and abilities were nothing to scoff at, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d probably have no shortage of people willing to pay to be with her. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Still, this might be fortunate for us, to a certain extent. If we agreed to her request, Sudou would gain the right to partner with a student with A-rank academic ability. And even if he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t end up getting to partner with her, we lost nothing.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not saying this just to make fun of us, then? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really serious about this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita in response, a serious look in her eyes.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m serious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see. In that case, I suppose we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take this seriously too, and hear you out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH-Hey, Suzune?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine! I </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">wanna</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> team up with someone strong, after all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right. In that case, Sudou-kun, you should accept her offer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cW-wait, hold up, Suzune. The school ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just gonna let us have a fight or whatever. Stuff\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get pretty bad if we fight, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? I mean like what happened last year, and at lunch, with that little tussle with that Housen dude. Right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Last year, Sudou had gotten in a fight with several guys from Ryuuen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s class and it had turned into quite the problem. And just today, there had been a big commotion when Housen came by.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certainly true that fighting isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly praiseworthy. But if both sides consent, there should be no issue. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think so, Ayanokouji-kun?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I took a moment to consider what Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intentions were in asking me that question. If she was asking me if there was no issue with such a fight, then my answer would obviously be that yes, there </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">would</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> be issues. Win or lose, even if both parties agreed to fight and then started swinging, there was essentially no way that school administrators would approve of something that essentially amounted to a duel. However, Horikita had responded to Amasawa in a way that sounded like she was condoning the idea of such a brawl.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right. If school officials heard talk of a fight, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d agree to let it happen. If the students involved all consent to the fight, however, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be a </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">huge </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">issue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I purposefully answered her back in a way that communicated I had no problem with it.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH-hey, Ayanokouji!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wailed Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn top of that, no matter who you picked from our grade level, no one would be able to beat Sudou-kun in a fight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGot that right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Sudou didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand what was going on, but Horikita and I were taking turns passing the baton back and forth to each other in this conversation. The important thing right now wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to affirm the idea of actually having a fight. It was to prove that Sudou was the strongest\\xe2\\x80\\x94</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">without</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> actually having him fight anyone.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be frank, Sudou-kun, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Think about it. Normally, it would be extremely difficult to pair you up with a student with A-rank academic ability. However, Amasawa-san has said that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s willing to partner with you. Understand? On top of that, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agreeing to partner with you on the condition of you winning a fight. A test of strength. Something you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re better at than anyone else. You should take this deal without a second\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hesitation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">There was no way a second-year student familiar with the school rules would carelessly agree to engage in a fight like this. On top of that, if their opponent was Sudou, the outcome was as clear as day. In other words\\xe2\\x80\\xa6even if we agreed to her terms here and now, the fight might never actually end up taking place. And even in the off chance that someone did take the challenge, Sudou could put them down.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOoh, nice! Nice! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 kind of excited!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amasawa, having just enrolled here, naturally knew none of this. There was no way she could understand how different this place was from a normal junior high or high school.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, could you promise us one thing, first? If no one shows up to this fight other than Sudou-kun, then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll agree to partner with him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita, hoping to confirm an important part of the deal.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If Amasawa didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree to that condition, this discussion would go any further.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure. I promise. If no challenger shows up, then he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll win by default,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">After Amasawa gave us her word, Horikita nodded, apparently satisfied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right, Sudou-kun?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked, turning to Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Sure. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a problem with it, Suzune, then I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sudou, balling both his hands into fists and then smacking them together in front of him, hard.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">As far as Horikita was concerned, Amasawa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal was both a product of chance and an invaluable opportunity.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOkey dokey, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll post a general message in the app for everyone to see. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell anyone who feels confident about their physical strength to shoot me a direct message before the end of the day if they wanna join in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeh. No matter who shows up, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take \\xe2\\x80\\x99em.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Conveniently enough, Sudou didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to understand what Horikita was thinking. He was probably just getting excited over the idea of fighting somebody hand-to-hand.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould it be all right if we select the location? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d prefer not to unintentionally let things slip to the school,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, sure. I think you guys would probably know more about that than me anyway. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll let you handle that part.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amasawa must have finished composing her message, because she turned to us for a final confirmation before sending it out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOkay, so once this goes out, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have our little test of strength. That okay with you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita nodded back in response. Amasawa slowly looked over all three of us. Then she turned her phone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s screen off and put it back in her pocket.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cActually, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not, after all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I had thought maybe she had a sudden change of heart, but that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to be the case. Judging from the look on her face, we should assume that she had been testing us, trying to feel us out. However, both Horikita and Sudou were flustered by Amasawa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abrupt change.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven if I put out a message asking for people, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem like anyone would show up. Based on Sudou-senpai\\xe2\\x80\\x99s physique, and the way both Horikita-senpai and Ayanokouji-senpai are acting, I can tell he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top dog in terms of strength in your grade level,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">So she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d come to understand there was no need to go through the trouble of making people fight to compare them. It seemed the little act Horikita and I had put on, as well as Sudou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s natural reaction, had been even more effective than we had expected. If Amasawa had only noticed all this after she posted the message, Horikita probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have let her take it back. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In order to not let Amasawa realize that we had been acting before, Horikita expressed her dissatisfaction. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you making fun of us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo way, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing like that, really. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just, like, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no fun when the outcome\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so obvious. I just want to see it with my own eyes and make sure he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the strongest. So please don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get all mad at me, senpai.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Amasawa pressed her forefinger against her lips, lost in thought for a moment.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll still give you a chance though, so come on, forgive me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita was trying to stay in control of the conversation, but kept getting knocked off balance by Amasawa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peculiar approach. It seemed she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t jive so well with people like Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I guess besides strong guys, I like guys who can cook,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCook?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Amasawa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s newest suggestion was once again something completely unrelated to the special exam.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, Sudou-senpai, right? Would you make me a home-cooked meal? Something, like, super extra yummy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA h-home-cooked meal?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stammered Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Sudou, who had been brimming with confidence just moments ago, now seemed overcome with shock after hearing her unexpected request.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean, it being tasty is a prerequisite, of course. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">gotta</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> be good. But you also have to make something that I specifically request,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cW-wait, I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ever cooked a meal in my life\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that so? Well, I guess that means I take back giving you a chance, hmm,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Amasawa, cutting him off.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita jumped into the conversation, not wanting to let this opportunity pass us by. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan I do it then, in Sudou-kun\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNope. I told you before, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I? I said I like guys who can cook. \\xe2\\x80\\x99Sides, if the guy I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m partnering up with can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cook, then there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no point in partnering with them at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Meaning it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter how well Horikita could cook. If you were a girl, Amasawa wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interested.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if Sudou-senpai is no good, why not give up on him and try to find a classmate who can cook? Oh, is that because even if you </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">did</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> go out and find someone in a hurry, I still wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be partnering with Sudou-senpai then, hm?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa, flashing a devilish grin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe you should work on turning Sudou-senpai into a master cook. Of course, I gotta wonder if you can really do that in time, huh. I </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">am</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> pretty popular, you know. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hurry, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably find a partner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just a hollow threat. She would probably find a partner in the not-too-distant future. There were many exceptionally talented students other than Horikita in our grade level. There was no need for Amasawa to deliberately take on the risk of partnering with the likes of Sudou. If anything, this was nothing more than a playful whim on her part. If she changed her mind even a little, that would be the end of it. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But a classmate who had poor grades </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">and </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">was a guy who was good at cooking? No one else came to mind at the moment. In that case, this request from Amasawa might just be a no-go for Class D. Giving up on her and going after other students would probably be a better use of our time. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When Amasawa saw we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t giving her an answer, she went on to add something else.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOkay. Well, how about I give you a little special treatment? I did want to partner with a guy who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good at cooking, but\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 If you can satisfy my taste buds, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be willing to team up with a good fighter like Sudou-senpai,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She was offering us a compromise. Amasawa wanted to partner up with a guy who was a good fighter </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">or</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> a good cook. In that case, we could certainly satisfy her.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI guess it would be like teaming up with a good cook and a good fighter at the same time, huh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Amasawa was saying she would be willing to partner up with Sudou as long as another guy could satisfy her. I\\xc2\\xa0wondered how Horikita would respond\\xe2\\x80\\xa6? But the problem was that I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really think of a student who fit the bill. We also seriously lacked the time necessary to teach someone how to cook. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAyanokouji-kun. If I recall, you once boasted to me that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re quite the skilled cook, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">What in the world was Horikita thinking, asking me a question like that so openly? I had never once told her anything of the sort, much less boasted about it. While it would have been easy for me to deny her assertion, it seemed necessary for me to play along and make sure our stories matched. The chances of Sudou being able to partner with a student with an A in academic ability weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly high.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be an exaggeration to say that cooking is my one and only area of expertise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, quite. Well then, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll permit it, Amasawa-san, how about Ayanokouji-kun?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs long as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a guy, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care who. But is he </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">really</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> a good cook, though? I mean, you can go ahead and say whatever you want, talk is cheap, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to judge you pretty harshly, okay?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be fine, of course. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita, turning to me.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, I guess so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">As soon as I agreed to it, Amasawa immediately clapped her hands together.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOkay! How about we get this show on the road and you show me what you can do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Things were moving way too quickly. However, what Amasawa had just said seemed like she was both sealing the deal and giving us an ultimatum. She wanted to avoid giving me enough of a grace period that I could go learn how to cook. She wanted to ascertain whether I really </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">was</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> as good as I claimed to be. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Since Horikita needed to make sure Amasawa believed her lie, she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go ahead and say yes to her request. Even if I were to go ahead and cook for Amasawa now, with my current level of skill, it was clear it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t amount to much. And even if Amasawa didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually judge me that harshly, I would probably still end up failing to meet her standards.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to, could you possibly give us a little time? Ayanokouji-kun and I are in the process of reaching out to first-year students to find partners for our classmates. Aside from Sudou-kun, there are many other students who need help. If the other classes beat us to the punch, then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll really be hurting. Even at this very moment, our rivals are scrambling to find partners,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita, explaining our situation to Amasawa, to see if she understood what we were dealing with. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf possible, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to put this on hold until after class on Friday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She rejected Amasawa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request to have me cook something for her right away. On top of that, she asked if we could postpone things for a couple of days, suggesting we could make some time on the weekend. </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see, I see. Well, I suppose you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right, it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be good for little ol\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me to take up all your time myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then Amasawa offered a new proposal. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be all right doing it later tonight, though. What about that? That wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a problem, would it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA first-year student going to a second-year student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dorm in the middle of the night\\xe2\\x80\\x94and a boy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, to boot\\xe2\\x80\\x94would most certainly be improper,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I see. But waitin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 until the weekend is kinda tough for me. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d lose the chance to partner up with any other of my senpai then\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Just as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d thought, Horikita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suggestion to wait until the weekend wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to fly. Amasawa came back with a pretty harsh reply this time.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut since this is kinda, like, fate or something, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you just one day. If you tell me you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cook something for me tomorrow after class, I guess we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just have to pretend this whole thing never happened,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That was probably the very last compromise she was willing to make. She was drawing a hard line. I got the sense that if we got too greedy, Amasawa would immediately pull back. If Horikita didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t slip up in her bargaining, then\\xe2\\x80\\xa6</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right. I certainly cannot deny that my request would place quite a burden on you. And besides, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to carelessly give us time to practice cooking. Right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, gosh, no, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that far ahead or anything,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6All right. Can we seal the deal then, with these terms?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">We only had one day of preparation time. However, if we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stick to those terms, we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to be able to hold onto Amasawa. What Horikita was agreeing to could be interpreted as desperate measures taken under pressure of necessity, but she signaled that she agreed to the amended proposal all the same.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s settled, then.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amasawa agreed readily, having no objection to meeting up tomorrow after class like she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d suggested earlier.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowever, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as long as you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take back what you said, like you did earlier when we were talking about having a fight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Horikita.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOkay. I promise. If I determine that his cooking skills are legit, then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll team up with Sudou-senpai right then and there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Although it was just a verbal promise, Amasawa nodded and answered honestly.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m beggin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ya, Ayanokouji. Use your cookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 skills to get me a partner, somehow!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wailed Sudou.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Given the situation, I figured I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d play along. But I never imagined things would turn out like this.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOkay, so, how about we meet up in front of Keyaki Mall at four thirty tomorrow after class? Would that be okay, Ayanokouji-senpai?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Amasawa.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the mall? Not at the dorms?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I asked in return.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gonna ask you to make is a secret!

So she was going to judge me on everything, starting with what I bought.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it okay if I accompany him too?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Horikita, probably looking to offer me advice, so that our ruse wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be discovered.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But our opponent wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to let that slide so easily.</span></p>\\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNope! You could give him advice, by like, signaling with your eyes and stuff.

      "['Chapter 4:These New First-Years are Nothing But Troublemakers\\xa0THERE WERE DOZENS of first- and second-year students gathered in the gym. Most of the people there weren’t second-years, but first-years. I supposed that many students saw this meet-and-greet as an important opportunity. Since I didn’t know who the first-years were at a glance right now anyway, I decided to start by finding out which second-year students were participating in this event. The leader of Class A, Sakayanagi, was nowhere to be seen. And while I didn’t know if I could exactly call him a stand-in for her, I did see Hashimoto Masayoshi. Sakayanagi had a disability affecting her legs, so her range of movement was limited, making her slow. Hashimoto played an important part in covering her to make up for\\xa0that. ', 'As far as I could tell, he was the only person from Class\\xa0A here. Furthermore, it didn’t seem like he was making an attempt to talk to anyone in particular. He was probably scouting around to see who got in touch with whom at this meet-and-greet.As the organizer for this event, about half of the people from Class B were in attendance, both guys and girls, Ichinose included. Kanzaki was there too, by Ichinose’s side, supporting her. However, I didn’t get the impression that the students in attendance from Class B were those that were either very good students or those who were concerned about their academic prowess. It seemed Class\\xa0B had simply chosen to send the more sociable members of their class.', 'On the other hand, after briefly looking around, I saw no sign of anyone from Class C around. It was almost as if they considered this meet-and-greet to be totally optional, right from the very beginning. Through this one event alone, you could somehow see the motives of each of the second-year classes. However, it wasn’t the second-year students who were important to Horikita today. She was focused on the first-years—the people we hardly knew at all. I was sure that the first-year students, who had only just started here, had no clue as to what was going on yet. Many of them were probably struggling to wrap their heads around the situation with second-year students suddenly asking to pair up with them. They shrank back from everyone else at the event, clinging to their classmates—which is to say, the students that they were already close with.', 'Upon seeing that, Ichinose tried her best to expand their circle by making self-introductions and casual chit-chat, without really mentioning the special exam. Of course, it wasn’t like people were about to immediately open up or anything. Knowing this, she didn’t rush things, but instead approached people slowly, looking at them with a gentle smile on her face. Then their hardened hearts, which seemed to have been frozen like ice, began to thaw. After only a few minutes of observation at this meet-and-greet, I had a general idea of how things were going to go from here.“Rather than prioritizing the special exam, she’s going about building relationships based on mutual trust, first. That is certainly a very Ichinose-san-like way of doing things. An admirable tactic, and one not everyone can pull off,” said Horikita, giving her first impression of the meet-and-greet.', 'It was unknown just how much Class B was going to make use of this strategy, but it was especially important, nonetheless. What Ichinose was doing could only benefit both the first- and second-year students. Horikita called Ichinose “admirable” for putting such a plan into action. Looking at Horikita’s side profile, I could guess at the strategy she must have been thinking of herself.“Are you thinking of a similar strategy yourself?” I asked.“…Yes. A strategy based on using Private Points is too much for Class D to handle. That’s why I thought it would be important for us to build relationships based on trust with the first-years. However, we’re no match for Ichinose-san in that regard at all. Or rather, I should say, that kind of strategy is her specialty,” said Horikita.', 'If you wanted someone to accept you as their partner, you needed to offer them something. That something could be a lot of different things, like points, trust, friendship, or a debt of gratitude.“Ichinose Honami-san from Class 2-B is already quite well-known among many of the first-years. They know her name and face. I’m sure anxious students will flock to her, and she’ll live up to their expectations,” added Horikita.“Yeah, I think so too,” I replied.They weren’t going to bother coming up to us, Class 2-D, people they didn’t know at all.“But even if we can’t duplicate her admirable methods, there are things we can do,” said Horikita.', 'Apparently, Horikita had gotten some kind of idea from this event. The crux of that idea probably had something to do with how she was constantly looking at the first-years with the OAA app open. She gave no sign of wanting to leave yet, continuing to observe the first-years. I wasn’t the only one standing beside her, watching, either. A large figure moved by us.“But, y’know, all of ’em look like total wimps. Every last one of ’em,” gruffed Sudou, standing beside Horikita, sharing what he thought about the first-years.', 'Sudou had originally planned to head straight for his club activities right after class today. But because Ichinose’s request to hold this meet-and-greet event was accepted, and it was thus suddenly decided that the gym would be in use until five o’clock, he offered to accompany Horikita here. Horikita had flatly turned him down, telling him it wasn’t necessary for him to come, but I guess it must have been fine in the end, since he was going to the gym anyway.“Don’t glare at them for no reason. There’s nothing to gain by scaring them,” said Horikita.', '“I ain’t really glarin’ or anything. This is just the way my face looks. Anyway, is it really okay for us to hang back and chill like this? Won’t the brainy kids get snatched up by Ichinose? What’s the harm in just talkin’ to ’em?” said Sudou impatiently, suggesting to Horikita that they ought to go and talk to the students sooner rather than\\xa0later.Even if a student from our grade level that wasn’t in Class B went to make a move on one of the first-years, Ichinose wouldn’t get upset about it. If anything, I was sure she’d welcome that happily.“What are you gonna do?” I asked Horikita, since I’d been wondering about that myself.“Do you really think we can outdo Class 2-B in a place like this, when it comes to socializing?” asked Horikita.', 'Right now, Ichinose seemed to be emphasizing providing relief for the first-years over trying to make sure her own class would win. From the looks of things, not a single one of the students from Class B had left yet, and they seemed to be trying to get to know the first-years better, to deepen their friendships. I bet the first-years had noticed their enthusiasm, too.“Yeah, I can’t really imagine that we could,” I replied.If Yousuke or Kushida were here, we could’ve stood a chance at schmoozing. Maybe. But Horikita, Sudou, and I most definitely lacked the ability to hold our own, socially. I was sure Horikita was well aware of that fact when she came here. Just as the discussion was about to begin in earnest, Horikita took action.“…Let’s go,” she said.', 'Instead of participating in the meet-and-greet, we were retreating. Which meant Horikita had had no intention of trying to bring any of the first-years over to our side at this event all along.“You sure that’s okay, Suzune?” asked Sudou.“More than half of the students who were invited didn’t come to this meet-and-greet. Those are the students I’m going to negotiate with,” said Horikita.', 'In other words, she was going to target the first-year students who hadn’t bothered to listen to Ichinose’s offer. At the same time, however, the fact that those students ignored Ichinose’s offer proved it would be difficult to win them over. They might think they could find a partner by themselves, based on their own abilities, without accepting a helping hand. Or perhaps they lacked the courage to come out to this meet-and-greet. They might even already have a strategy in mind. Whatever the case might be, we could assume many of them probably would be a little eccentric, and hard to deal with. “For the time being, let’s hear your basis for going that route,” I said.', '“Two reasons. As far as I can tell, from what I saw just moments earlier, an unexpectedly high percentage of the students who came to the meet-and-greet were people concerned about their academic prowess. What we are looking for right now, rather urgently I might add, are students who have at least a B minus or better in academic ability. Meaning, the students who have enough confidence to do battle without coming to the meet-and-greet,” said Horikita.I see. If that was the case, I supposed it made a certain amount of sense for us to have left the meet-and-greet.“Our top priority shouldn’t be to pair two A-rank students with one another. It’s about coaxing students with enough academic ability to cover for the weaker students in our class to come to our side, to make sure that absolutely no one gets expelled,” said Horikita.', 'However, even if Class 2-B did save a lot of the first-years, there would naturally be a lot of them left over. Moreover, Ichinose was probably going to prioritize saving the less capable students over helping the highly capable ones. It was possible that we could have picked up some of the leftover students from the meet-and-greet—ones who were better students, to an extent. I\\xa0assumed\\xa0her second reason had something to do with that.“Besides, there was a little bit of a bias in the students who attended the meet-and-greet, regardless of academic ability,” said Horikita.“Bias?”“The fact that none of the students from Class 1-D attended at all,” said Horikita.None of them had attended? I see. That certainly was a rather interesting bias. “It seems like you understand, too,” Horikita said.', '“Understand what? What does the fact that none of the kids from Class 1-D showed up mean?” asked Sudou, cutting in. He cocked his head to the side, not understanding what the significance of their absence was.“There are forty people in one class. Among those forty are students with poor grades and students who aren’t particularly good at communication. And yet, not a single person from Class 1-D participated. The fact that no one had attended is obviously a reflection of the will of the class,” said Horikita.It was clear that someone was controlling the entire class, and had instructed them not to participate in the meet-and-greet. You could certainly say that was unusual, considering that it hadn’t even been a few days since the semester started.“So, you’re sayin’ there’s already a leader in their class, and that person’s kept ’em from going to this meet-and-greet…?” said Sudou.', '“If there’s a person we can negotiate with who speaks for the entire class, then it’s no longer necessary for us to try and bargain with people individually,” said Horikita.In other words, her strategy was for the students in each of our classes, 1-D and 2-D, to cover one another.“Okay, that’s all well and good. But if we do that, we’re not gonna stand a chance at winnin’ this thing, are we?” Sudou asked.It wasn’t a bad idea at all, to keep anyone from getting expelled. But it would probably make it impossible for us to beat the other classes in overall scores.“You’re right. In that sense, I’m not planning to wage war with the other classes this time around,” said Horikita.“I ain’t exactly in a position to really say much of anythin’ about that, but are you sure that’s what you want?” said Sudou.“Yes. Without a doubt,” stated Horikita, clearly and definitively.', 'Although her approach was certainly different, the general idea behind her strategy was similar to Ichinose’s, from the sound of it. The thinking was that you’d be giving up your chance at a valuable opportunity to get Class Points, a special exam. Class A’s Hashimoto was already leaving the gym, perhaps because he was done snooping around Ichinose’s meet-and-greet event. Horikita followed Hashimoto, proceeding to the gym exit. Sudou and I followed her. But just before I left, I briefly looked back at Ichinose. Ichinose, not noticing my presence, was talking to a first-year student with a smile on her face. I was sure she wouldn’t hesitate to extend a helping hand, regardless of that student’s academic ability score. Even if it was D or E. ', 'She was fighting to prevent anyone in her class from getting expelled, abandoning the idea of achieving victory in this special exam. It was about the same as what Horikita was trying to do, albeit in a different way. Or was it? Was the essence of their strategies really the same? “Yo.”Just as we left the gym, Hashimoto called out to us, as if he had been waiting for us.“Man, she’s the same as ever, isn’t she? Ichinose, I mean,” he said.“It seems she’s prioritizing saving her classmates and the first-years, yes,” said Horikita.“Yeah, for sure. Definitely doesn’t seem like Ichinose’s a threat at the moment. Doesn’t she get what a disadvantage it’ll be for her to take in a bunch of morons? Man, it’s like she’s throwin’ the game,” said Hashimoto exasperatedly. ', 'There was no way he could have realized Horikita was going for pretty much the same thing, probably because he couldn’t even imagine the thought of Horikita giving up on trying to win.“Maybe it’s because she already knew that about the first-years that she was able to set up a meeting like this in the first place?” said Horikita.“Ah, yeah, I getcha. That’s true,” said Hashimoto.“You Class A people… Sakayanagi-san understood without even needing to see the meet-and-greet. The reason she didn’t participate was because she already anticipated what kind of students were going to show up here,” said Horikita.“Well, maybe,” said Hashimoto.Even so, she had probably sent Hashimoto in alone as a scout.“So, how are you planning to get the honors students over to your side?” asked Horikita.“That’s all up to the princess. I’m just following her orders.” ', 'With that reply, Hashimoto started to walk away, perhaps because he was satisfied with the brief exchange we just had.“Don’t trust a word that jerkoff Hashimoto says, Suzune.”“You don’t need to tell me that. Wait, are you familiar with Hashimoto-kun?” asked Horikita.“Nope, not at all,” said Sudou proudly, arrogantly.“…I see. Well, Class A has a big advantage simply by being Class A. I suppose it’s only natural that they’ll have some people flocking to them, to a certain extent,” said Horikita.Having enrolled here, the new students were eventually going to realize that Class A reigned supreme. Even if they didn’t know that fact right now, word would get around quickly.“Anyway, let’s hurry. Class D students should still be hanging around at school at this hour,” said Horikita, heading towards the first-year classrooms.', 'We were going to see what things were like for Class 1-D. Apparently, she was seizing the opportunity presented to us while everyone else was focused on the meet-and-greet.4.1WE MADE OUR WAY to the floor where the first-year students were—the floor we’d been regularly going to until just last month. There didn’t seem to be many students around, considering that quite a few had gone over to the gym. We looked around and saw several students, from Class A through Class C. Even though we didn’t actually call out to them, when they spotted us and recognized us as upperclassmen, they looked away, as if it were awkward or uncomfortable.', 'I supposed there was no way we’d be welcomed with open arms all that easily, after suddenly setting foot on the first-years’ floor. There were a few students who didn’t seem to mind us, but most of them didn’t exactly like the uncomfortable awkwardness of having us there. That would probably be the case tomorrow, and every day thereafter, too. I was sure that some students, trying to find a partner as soon as possible, would approach first-years at all times of the day, both mornings and afternoons. But that was a dangerous gamble that might end up backfiring. Even so, there were students chatting and laughing happily in the first-year classrooms into which we peeked. Maybe they felt like there was no need to panic about this special exam. Or perhaps they didn’t see it as that big a deal yet.', '“Well, it seems like a lot of the students who had stayed behind aren’t too worried, after all,” said Horikita.“Well, that’s nice. And here I’m freakin’ out and all,” gruffed Sudou. The first-year students would only have their Private Point payouts suspended for three months if they scored five hundred points or less on the exam. That was still definitely a huge loss, of course, but since the initial deposit into their accounts should have been made right after the entrance ceremony, they probably felt no sense of impending danger.Just as we were finishing our inspection of Class 1-C, Horikita heard a familiar voice call out to her.“Ku ku. You got here pretty late, Suzune.”The owner of that voice was none other than Ryuuen Kakeru, from Class 2-C, staring at us fearlessly. Just up ahead, we could see the classroom for Class 1-D. It looked like Ryuuen had just stepped out of that room.', '“Are you here scouting out first-year students too, Ryuuen-kun? I don’t recall seeing you at the meet-and-greet,” said Horikita.“It was just a buncha moronic half-wits who got together at the gym, right? I didn’t even need to go see it to know that,” said Ryuuen.He had come here looking for students who didn’t go to the meet-and-greet, just like Horikita had been planning to do. Judging from the way he was talking, it was clear he was after the top-level first-year students. There had been only about a slight twenty- or thirty-minute difference in our timing, but… With that much time, it was possible that he had already successfully scouted a number of students. We would be able to check whether each student had settled on a partner at eight o’clock the next morning. “Relax. Still haven’t settled on anybody yet,” said Ryuuen.', 'Not that the other two people with me today would believe him so easily, though. That is, until the app actually refreshed, and it showed what partnerships had been finalized or not for Class 2-C.“You look like you don’t believe me,” sneered Ryuuen.“Well, I’m taking everything you say with a grain of salt, at the very least,” replied Horikita.“Huh, okay. Looks like you’ve gotten pretty wary of me, huh?” “Oh? I can’t recall ever once not being wary of you before though. Hm?” “Kukuku! Well, yeah, guess you’ve got a point there,” said Ryuuen.Sudou glared at Ryuuen, perhaps not liking the mocking way he spoke to Horikita. A normal person would have shrunk back in fear from that glare alone, but such a direct attack wouldn’t work on Ryuuen.“Looks like you’ve hired yourself a bodyguard. But you chose a dumb one, lady,” sneered Ryuuen.“What’d you say?” huffed Sudou.', 'He looked ready to fly off the handle, but Horikita kept him in line with a gentle wave of her hand.“Oh, do you need brains to be a bodyguard? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black, hm?” said Horikita.She didn’t avert her eyes from Ryuuen as she delivered that comeback, still holding her hand out to keep Sudou back. “Are you planning on scaring the first-years? I’m afraid that taking that kind of attitude with them is going to backfire on you,” said Horikita.They would certainly shrink back if they saw Ryuuen strutting about like he was the cock of the walk. “I figured if I threatened ’em a little, they’d immediately agree to cooperate,” said Ryuuen.Horikita had been going tit-for-tat with Ryuuen so far, dishing back what Ryuuen was giving her. But Ryuuen did the opposite this time, actually affirming what she had just suggested.', '“…You’re kidding, right? Do you really think that’s an acceptable way of doing things?” asked Horikita.“Acceptable or not, who friggin’ cares. What’s the problem if someone feels a little threatened? We were told that we couldn’t force someone to get a lower score or anythin’, but there wasn’t anythin’ about not using threats to find a partner in the rules,” said Ryuuen.“That’s because it should go without saying that it’s not okay, without it needing to be outlined in the rules. If there is a problem, you’ll be in trouble,” said Horikita.“Then show me where the problem is. I ain’t gonna do somethin’ dumb enough that it’d get traced back to me, anyway,” said Ryuuen.', 'He was as bullish and cocksure as ever. Not only was he saying it was extremely likely that he’d make good on his threats, but he also stated, quite definitively, that the truth of the matter would never get out. Whether what he was saying was truth or falsehood, Horikita, too, must have realized once again that Ryuuen would always opt to rule with the iron hand of a military dictator.“Well, in that case, do whatever you like. But if any evidence should present itself, I will raise the issue, without question. Or mercy,” said Horikita.Her warning was probably meant to serve as a deterrent, but it didn’t seem to resonate with Ryuuen.“So? You think you can win anybody over to your class?” sneered Ryuuen.Horikita must have determined that there was no need for her to answer, because she kept her mouth shut.', '“You figured somethin’ out when you were snoopin’ around the meet-and-greet, huh? And then you hurried on over here to see who was left. That it?” said Ryuuen.“The same as you then, perhaps?” “Ku ku. Yeah, maybe.”Ryuuen continued speaking to Horikita after saying that, as if all he wanted was to keep things interesting. “In that case, I’ll tell ya somethin’ good, since we’re on the same wavelength. This year’s batch of fresh meat are all real calm, even though they only just started here. Which means there’s a real good chance that someone from the school is telling these new kids how things work, to a certain extent,” said Ryuuen.', 'If that was true, it was quite an unexpected bit of intel. Back in April, we’d no idea what was going on, and everyone just messed around as much as they wanted as a result. Of course, the students from Class A and Class B were more composed, but that could probably be attributed to the significant difference between our backgrounds. Also, what Ryuuen was talking about wasn’t just a specific class. He was referring to the entire grade level. Maybe this was a measure that had been taken because they had to partner up with second-year students right at the start of school? Or did the school have other intentions, perhaps?“Isn’t it possible that this year’s batch of new students are just especially quick-witted, and we were just exceptionally slow?” replied Horikita.“There’s signs that some of ’em are already coming together, as a class, right at this stage. That’s way too early.”', 'Even if they’d immediately started trying to come together as a class when the special exam was announced, they wouldn’t have succeeded already. Ryuuen was saying they wouldn’t have come together like this, now, unless they started the process at an early stage. Right after they entered the school.“…What kind of cowardly trick are you trying to pull by telling me this?” asked Horikita.“Nothin’, no trick. You can’t just pulverize your opponents in this special exam. Nothin’ like that. But if you’re gonna win overall, you’re probably gonna have to pull several strings,” said Ryuuen.', 'It wasn’t going to be easy to get students from the other classes expelled in this special exam. The sense of anonymity in it, of wondering who was going to be partnered with who, was fairly significant. It was going to be quite difficult to ascertain exactly who people were partnered with on the app, unless people were going around making partnerships known publicly or you were very good at gathering information. Even if you were able to get classmates who didn’t do so well academically to partner with students from rival classes, or even if you were to specifically designate someone for that purpose, it would be almost impossible to get that student to purposefully cut corners on the test.', 'If you got a low score—one out of keeping with the level of academic ability you were supposed to have—it would clearly be intentional, and then you’d get expelled regardless of what grade level you were in. In the end, the difference between victory and defeat came down to two things: the abilities of the students in your own class, and the abilities of the first-year students. In terms of strategy, what you could do was win as many academically skilled first-years over to your class as possible. ', 'It wasn’t going to be easy for Class C to come out on top in this exam, considering their low levels of overall ability. There was no way they could hope to compete with Class A financially, and the academic skills of the two classes were on entirely different levels. No matter how much money they threw at the first-years to try and poach them, the results weren’t going to be pretty. In that case, they should abandon the idea of trying to win first place overall and aim instead for the individual competition, with rewards given to the top thirty percent.Of course, Horikita didn’t make any mention of that. Because it would be a problem for us if Class A and Class C weren’t trying to duke it out with each other for overall points. Rather than let Class A easily snatch the top spot, I was hoping A and C would fight it out on a grand scale, so they’d wear each other down, if only a little. ', '“Try your best to keep up,” chided Ryuuen.“I suppose I could say the same to you. Your concerns are completely unnecessary,” said Horikita.“Ku ku. Well, my bad.” Then Ryuuen immediately left, vacating the first-year students’ floor. He had been here too short a time to have finished what needed doing.“The first-years might resist us much more strongly than I thought they would,” said Horikita.If they were aware of the fact that they were basically locked in a desperate struggle to the death with the other classes at this school, then yes, I supposed it was only natural they’d be hesitant to negotiate with us.“In that case, shouldn’t we try and negotiate with ’em at least a little, as soon as we can?” said Sudou.“Yes… Of course we should. But…”Horikita directed her gaze towards the end of the hall. She was looking at where the classroom for Class 1-D\\xa0was.“Let’s get goin’,” said Sudou.', '“I don’t think it’s going to be that simple,” said Horikita.Apparently, Horikita had noticed it too while she was talking with Ryuuen. The entire time they talked, from when Ryuuen strolled out of the classroom to when he left, not a single student had been seen leaving the classroom. And we didn’t hear a single sound as we approached the room, either. When we eventually reached the door to the classroom and opened it, our suspicions were confirmed.“D-dude, what the hell’s goin’ on?!” yelled Sudou in a panic, as he scanned the inside of the classroom from end to end.“Negotiating with Class 1-D might be much, much more difficult than I expected,” said Horikita.The classroom was completely empty. There wasn’t a single person in sight. The forty students, who hadn’t shown up to the meet-and-greet either, seemed to have suddenly disappeared without a trace.', '“This class might be more trouble than I had thought,” she added.However, it wasn’t like we could just sit here and wallow in our anxiety. We needed to take action before the other classes really started making their moves in earnest. The competition was starting tomorrow. Horikita’s battle was going to begin the moment that she contacted Class 1-D. As for me, I was going to head back to my dorm and memorize all the names and faces of the new students in the OAA app. Horikita had her battle to fight, and I had mine. And as it turned out, on the day the special exam was announced, a total of twenty-two partnerships had been finalized.4.2\\xa0THE SITUATION TOOK A SUDDEN, unexpected turn near the end of our lunch break on the next day. Something happened after we had finished eating our lunches, while we sat in our classroom, casually waiting for our afternoon classes to begin.', '“H-hey! Dudes! Some first-years are headed this way!” shouted one of my classmates, Miyamoto.This special exam depended on first- and second-year students working together. You’d think this wouldn’t be such a surprising development, but apparently, that wasn’t the case.“Wow, they must be awfully brave to come up to the upperclassmen’s floor,” said Yousuke, while I mulled things over in my head. “I mean, if we decided to head up to the third-year’s floor, we’d have to be very careful not to make a fuss.”“Yeah, that’s true…”It would be a different story if you had a lot of close friendships with your senpai, but for this year’s batch of new students, that wasn’t the case. Many of them must have felt like they were venturing into enemy territory. I\\xa0supposed that in that sense, some of them showing up like this might actually be an event that merited surprise. ', 'Yousuke said he was going to go check it out, so I followed him, heading out into the hallway. Horikita and Sudou followed right after us. The first thing that caught my eye was a guy with a particularly large build. There were several reasons why he stood out, one of which was that he seemed to be around Sudou’s height. But, more than that, it was the strong impression he made as he walked confidently down the center of the hall on our floor. The other second-year students in the hall avoided him, walking at the edges of the hallway. Which seemed like the opposite of what you’d normally expect. Following a little way behind this student was a girl. Horikita, realizing that they weren’t simply here looking for partners, stepped out in front of the male student to block his path. Sudou stuck close to her.', 'When Horikita and Sudou came face-to-face with these new students, the first-year student made eye contact with me for some reason, even though I was watching from some distance away. Shortly afterward, he looked away from me and shifted his gaze to Horikita. I\\xa0pulled up the data I had learned from the OAA yesterday in my memory. It seemed Horikita was about to make rather unexpected contact with that class.“Who’s this chick?” asked the guy.“Please wait a moment… I’ve found it,” said the girl.After fiddling with her phone for a short while, she showed him her screen.“Class 2-D. Horikita Suzune. Academic ability A-, huh?” said the guy, gruffly.', 'The girl spoke in a rather polite tone of voice, unlike the guy, which made them seem like quite the odd combination. They then directed their gazes over at Sudou, who was standing beside Horikita. And just like before, the girl showed the guy her phone screen. “Sudou Ken… Heh.” After looking at Sudou’s data, the guy let out a mocking snort.“Hello, my name is Nanase, from Class 1-D. He’s from the same class. This is—”“Housen,” he said, interrupting her.They both gave us their last names. Just for reference, the large guy’s full name was Housen Kazuomi and the girl’s was Nanase Tsubasa. They were both genuine Class\\xa01-D students, just as they had said they were. Students from the very same that we’d tried to meet with yesterday, but couldn’t. ', 'Although their sudden arrival here was rather unexpected, it was both a lucky break and a stroke of ill fortune for Horikita. That was because we couldn’t exactly start negotiating with Class 1-D out in the open, while under the watchful eyes of the other classes.“For a couple of new students, you’ve done something quite brave. I admire your pluck,” said Horikita.“Huh? What, you admire our pluck? Don’t act so high and mighty, woman,” snapped Housen.“She ain’t bein’ high and mighty, dude. Don’t get all full of yourself, kid,” shouted Sudou.Housen had snapped at Horikita, causing Sudou to snap back at him in turn. Even though they were about the same height, Housen had a slightly bigger build, making Sudou look a bit smaller in comparison.“Dude, your score’s an E+. Guess you’re just as much of a moron as you look,” said Housen.“What was that?!” shouted Sudou.', '“Well, whatever, this is fine. Looks like this place is crawling with Class D rejects anyway. Works for me.”“What is that supposed to mean?” asked Horikita.“As I said, you Class D punks are all just a bunch of rejects, leftovers. You can’t even form pairs unless we pick you. So I figured, hey, I’ll lend you incompetent, braindead morons a hand. You get what I’m sayin’?” said\\xa0Housen.It was almost as if he was testing Horikita.“Meaning you want us to team up with you. And you’re making your request with a rather condescending attitude,” she replied.“Uh, yeah? I mean, you’re the ones who should be beggin’ us to team up with you. Hell, I even dragged myself all the way out here,” Housen snapped back at Horikita, basically implying we weren’t in remotely the same position. “Come on. Go ahead and beg. Say, ‘Please, please team up with us,’ and start bowin’.”', 'Horikita, still holding Sudou back to keep him from losing his temper, argued back at him, her words growing in intensity despite the difference in size between her and Housen. “You seem to be misunderstanding something. Our positions are equal.”“Equal? Your idiot friend over there oughta be the only one spewing bullshit like that,” said Housen.“You’re in Class D, just like us. There’s no difference between us,” said Horikita.“You don’t get it. There are plenty of things we can do to you if we feel like it. Get it? I mean, you don’t want trouble, right? Then you should know your place and start beggin’.”Apparently, this Housen person had already noticed that the first-years had a secret weapon they could use to their advantage. ', '“And just what are these things you could do to us?” asked Horikita. She likely already knew the answer, but deliberately asked anyway, to make Housen come out and say it.“Come on, you know, dontcha? What I’m sayin’ is that we can get bad test scores, on purpose,” said Housen.When Horikita heard him say that, she bit her lip with some force.“Huh?! Enough already, you little first-year punk! You mess up the test, and you’ll get kicked outta school!” shouted Sudou.“Stop. Don’t be so quick to lose your cool, Sudou-kun. That’s a bad habit of yours,” said Horikita.“But…”I could understand why Sudou would want to vent his anger after hearing Housen talk to Horikita like that. However, what Housen was saying wasn’t a lie.', '“Yeah, it’s true that if you mess up on the test on purpose, you get expelled. But the penalty for not bein’ able to find a partner before time’s up is different. That only applies to you guys, right?” said Housen.The rules stated that if you ran out of time before you found a partner, one would be randomly assigned to you. On top of that, if you ran out of time, it would result in a 5 percent penalty taken off your overall score. And the second-year students, who could face expulsion, would take more damage from that penalty.“I-is that really true?!” shouted Sudou, incredulous.He shot Horikita a pleading look, seeking confirmation on whether what Housen said was true. The only answer she could possibly give him was ‘yes.’', '“Wouldn’t you be putting a noose around your own neck by doing that, though? Do you really intend on taking a loss immediately after you’ve started school?” asked Horikita.If you got hit with a penalty, your chances of getting five hundred and one points or more on the test would naturally plummet.“Well, compared to you guys, can’t say we’d get hurt all that bad. Ain’t that right?” sneered Housen. He looked to the girl standing behind him, Nanase, for confirmation.“Yes, that’s correct. We wouldn’t have any Private Points deposited into our account for three months, but that would still only be a maximum of two hundred forty thousand points. I don’t think it would be a fatal setback,” replied Nanase.“Get the picture now, Horikita-senpai?”', 'Housen regarded Horikita as though he were superior to her, even though she was his senior. Sudou, seeing him treat her that way, must have lost his patience. He stood in front of Horikita now, exuding intimidation, though he still wasn’t throwing any punches.“You wanna go?” said Housen, without any hesitation whatsoever.“Don’t get too full of yourself, punk,” huffed Sudou.“Don’t lose your cool, Sudou-kun. You do understand how things work at this school, don’t you?” said Horikita.It wasn’t unreasonable for the new students not to know this, but the hallways were supervised quite closely by school officials. The surveillance cameras were constantly monitoring us, so if there was a problem, the school officials could go dig up the footage.“I know…” said Sudou.', 'After having been repeatedly admonished by Horikita, Sudou backed off, though he looked irritated. It was certainly a problem that he got riled up so easily, but I supposed the fact that all it took was a word from Horikita to keep him in check was a relief.Just then, as Sudou’s attention was focused on Horikita, Housen thrust his large hand forward against Sudou’s chest and shoved him.“Wha-?!”In the next instant, Sudou lost his balance, falling backward, landing on his hands.“Ha, only thing big about you is your height, loser. Just a little tap was all it took?” sneered Housen.', 'What Housen just did was so reckless that even the other second-year students watching the situation couldn’t hide their unease. Considering how dramatic the action had been, it wouldn’t have been surprising for it to be seen as an act of violence. If you understood how difficult and risky it was to try and do something violent in this school, you couldn’t do it. We’d thought this year’s batch of new students were more familiar with how things worked at this school than students from previous years. If the information we had gotten from Ryuuen the other day was true, then I had to say what Housen had just done was quite reckless.Maybe they actually didn’t understand the school as well as we thought they did? No, it didn’t seem like that was the case. If so, then…“Asshole!” ', 'Sudou, having regained his composure and realized what had just been done to him, looked ready to let all his pent-up anger explode at once. But right before that happened, another guy, who had been watching the situation from afar, jumped in.“Dude, the hell are you doin’?!”It was Ishizaki Daiichi from Class 2-C. He was quick to lose his temper and could be easily categorized as a delinquent, but he was also a compassionate person. It seemed like he’d run out of patience after seeing Sudou, someone from his grade level, being treated with such cruelty.“Man, these losers just keep poppin’ up outta nowhere, one after another. Like cockroaches,” said Housen with a smirk, as if he found the situation amusing.The girl who had introduced herself earlier as Nanase moved to rein him back in.', '“Housen-kun, I thought we came here to have a discussion? If we came here just so you could get violent, then I’ll be leaving,” said Nanase.“Violent? All I did was touch the guy, like I was pettin’ a cat or somethin’. Well, sorry, my bad, Sudou,” said Housen, purposefully addressing Sudou without an honorific, as if he were spitting on him.“Hey, man, you’re goin’ too far! Knock that crap off!” shouted Ishizaki, reaching out to grab Housen by his collar.The moment that Housen saw Ishizaki’s arm reaching for him, though, the corners of his mouth curved up slightly into a smirk.“Better think twice, Ishizaki, unless you wanna die,” someone warned.Ishizaki stopped just before he took hold of Housen’s collar. The warning had come from none other than Ryuuen, who had also been standing by, watching.', '“Wh-why’d you stop me?!” huffed Ishizaki. He seemed visibly confused by the fact that Ryuuen had stopped him. Ibuki, a classmate of theirs, was also surprised by what Ryuuen had just done. “What do you think you’re doing? By stopping him, I mean?” she asked.Ryuuen generally welcomed fights. He was the furthest possible thing from a person who hated trouble. He didn’t care if there were security cameras around or not; when he wanted to throw down, he did so without hesitation. Which was precisely why it was so surprising to see him stop a fight from happening. Ryuuen ordered Ishizaki back and then approached Housen himself.“So, what, you’re supposed to be my opponent now? Dude, you look weak compared to that moron Sudou over there,” said Housen mockingly, after getting a look at Ryuuen.Ryuuen certainly wasn’t a big and brawny guy. I supposed that was why Housen considered him weak.', '“I know you pretty well, yeah. I remember hearin’ that this Housen dude was a bit of a celebrity in my hometown. I never imagined he’d look like such a total braindead idiot, though,” replied Ryuuen.Housen repeatedly hurled insults at Sudou over and over, calling him stupid, so Ryuuen threw the same insult right back in his face. Something that was honestly quite typical of Ryuuen. Normally, Ryuuen was an enemy to every class that wasn’t his own, but it was heartening to see him stand up to Housen like this. In fact, Sudou had successfully managed to bottle up his anger thanks to the change in atmosphere.“Y-you know this dude, Ryuuen-san?” asked Ishizaki.“Wait. Ryuuen, you say?”When Housen heard Ryuuen’s name, the look on his face changed. And then his wide mouth cracked open into an amused smile.', '“Hey now, ain’t this somethin’? This has gotta be fate. Honestly, I’ve heard your name get thrown around so much that it’s been pissin’ me off, Ryuuen,” said Housen.“Wow, so you’ve got the brain cells to actually remember someone’s name?” replied Ryuuen.Apparently, these two had known about each other for some time now. It seemed like Housen, from Class 1-D, came from somewhere close to Ryuuen’s hometown. That said, looking at the relationship between Ryuuen and Ishizaki and Ibuki, it seemed safe to say that Ryuuen had made a full comeback. He had temporarily stepped down from his position, but he was beginning to take command of his class once again.“Gotta say though, for the fabled Ryuuen to look all scrawny and pitiful… Damn, that’s a shame,” said Housen.“Meanwhile you look like just as much of a musclebound freak as I imagined,” sneered Ryuuen.', '“Y’know, I swung around your old hangouts a couple of times because I was plannin’ to beat the everlovin’ shit out of you. But I guess the reason I never ran into you was because you were terrified of me and hid, huh? What, you’ve been runnin’ away and making your little soldiers do all the work? Is that it?” said Housen.“Ku ku. I’d say it’s more like lady luck saved your ass, Housen. If you had met me back then, you certainly wouldn’t be acting like such a bigshot right now. I guess you really lucked out, ’cause you can say you haven’t lost to me yet,” said Ryuuen.“Actually, I think you just ran with your tail between your legs. If you’re tryin’ to tell me that’s not how it is, then how about we settle things, right here and now?” ', 'Housen formed his giant hand into a fist, looking confident. If he knew who Ryuuen was in junior high, the impression he had of Ryuuen shouldn’t be all that different from the impression we had of Ryuuen. Perhaps he didn’t see Ryuuen as someone that you want as an enemy?“Yeah, hard pass. I ain’t plannin’ on fighting a gorilla like you when there’s nothing in it for me,” said Ryuuen.Even though Housen was fixing for a fight, Ryuuen turned his offer down. Of course, that was because there was no way that he could actually fight in a place like this, but… I was sure Ishizaki and Ibuki had thought Ryuuen would accept the offer, even if that meant they had to take the fight elsewhere. “Wait, is this dude all that dangerous? I mean, sure, he’s bigger than Sudou and all, but…” said Ishizaki.', '“Who can say?” Ryuuen seemed to have no intention of giving a straight answer to that question. Then he issued an order to his subordinates, a smirk on his face. “Let’s go.”“Are you really okay with letting a first-year disrespect you like this?” asked Ibuki. She was aware of the fact that it was in Ryuuen’s nature to throw down against anyone, no matter who it was. That was why she couldn’t help but ask him that question.“Heh. We can settle things whenever. What’s the rush?” replied Ryuuen, quietly and calmly.While it would have been fine had things ended right there, Housen started walking forward, closing the distance between himself and Ryuuen.“Is that chick one of your little soldiers too?” asked Housen, after having watched them bicker earlier. “Yeah, somethin’ like that,” said Ryuuen.“Huh? What are you talking about? Don’t go and act like you’re the boss of me,” snapped Ibuki.', '“So you even stoop to using chicks as soldiers, huh, Ryuuen?” asked Housen.“Could say the same to you, buddy. You’re the one who brought that cute little thing over there, right?” said Ryuuen.Just like how Ryuuen was accompanied by Ibuki, Housen had Nanase standing beside him.“She ain’t mine. Well, whatever, I couldn’t care less about that. Let’s have some fun, Ryuuen,” said Housen.“Already told ya. Hard pass.”No matter how many times Housen tried to provoke Ryuuen into fighting, Ryuuen wouldn’t budge. As if to signal his disinterest, Ryuuen turned his back on Housen, showing that he’d made his mind up about withdrawing.“Huh, that so? In that case…”Housen must have decided Ryuuen’s failure to take the bait was no fun, because he suddenly extended his arm in a smooth, casual movement. He reached out for Ibuki. She tried to brush him off.However…', 'Just as she tried to brush him off, he quickly accelerated the force behind the movement, grabbing Ibuki by the neck and raising her up into the air. “Ngh?!”Ibuki hurriedly tried to free herself from his grip, as if a distress signal were being transmitted from her brain to the rest of her body in that instant. However, Housen merely flashed an audacious grin, not giving an inch, as if his arms were made of steel. Ryuuen turned back around and saw Ibuki being choked out by Housen. She tried to break free of his grip, deftly using her arms and legs, but Housen still didn’t budge. “Hah. Just try and slip outta that. Or, all of you watchin’ can jump in and get a piece of me too,” said Housen.', 'Judging by the look on Housen’s face, it wasn’t that he was fearless—but rather, that he possessed a kind of absolute confidence. However, I was certain this wasn’t the kind of situation where I could step into the ring myself. If I made a scene right here and now, the school would naturally get wind of it and inevitably show up to put a stop to the situation. The only one who wasn’t tied down by such concerns—Ryuuen—was the one who made a move, though he looked rather exasperated about it. Probably moving to save Ibuki rather than strike a blow against Housen, he moved forward, slipping into the space between Ibuki and Housen, near his chest. However, Housen still kept his grip tight on Ibuki’s neck. And even in this situation, where his movement was limited, he continued to sidestep Ryuuen’s repeated kicks. “Asshole!” shouted Ishizaki.', 'Ishizaki, who had been told to stand down before, now jumped into the fray. A commotion was starting to erupt, the likes of which you could never imagine happening in the hallways here at school.“Yeah, yeah! Man, am I glad I came all the way to this school,” said Housen.A genuine, no-holds-barred fight might actually start any second now. Amid all this, Nanase, who had been watching the situation from the onset, opened her mouth to speak.“Please stop, Housen-kun.”Despite the handicap of still having Ibuki in his grasp, Housen looked ready to start brawling with Ryuuen and Ishizaki as they barreled down on him. But he stopped moving after his classmate Nanase called out to him.“What’d you just say?” he asked.Rather than heed her warning, he looked irritated by the fact that she had spoken up and butted in.', '“The upperclassmen have all been concerned about the fact that there are surveillance cameras around here for a while now. Judging from the situation, I’ve determined there’s nothing to be gained by getting violent here,” said Nanase.“Yeah, I know. I know already, I was just messin’ around with ’em,” said Housen, before adding that he knew all along that we second-years were tied down because of the surveillance cameras.If that was the case, everything Housen had just done after showing up here really was quite puzzling. He ignored Nanase’s warning, looking as though he was about to resume fighting, so she spoke up once more, in a firmer tone than before.“If you do understand, then that’s all the more reason you should stop. If you’re going to try to waste more time here, then I have an idea of my own. I’m considering bringing that up and telling everyone here about it,” said Nanase.', 'After Housen heard her mention that, whatever abstract idea it was supposed to represent, he stopped moving once again. Then, with a look of total boredom on his face, he let go of Ibuki and dropped her to the floor, where she coughed and hacked. “Hey, not bad, Nanase. But just know that if you don’t live up to my expectations, I won’t show you any mercy. Even if you’re a girl. Got it?” said Housen.“When that time comes, I’ll take whatever comes my way,” said Nanase.Even though Housen had just threatened her, Nanase didn’t sound upset. She seemed so calm that it was like it didn’t matter one bit to her that she was currently standing on the second-years’ floor. ', 'Even so, this Housen guy was certainly no pushover. There was no shortage of people in my grade level who could boast of their fighting prowess. Among the guys, that included Ryuuen, Sudou, and Albert. Even though Housen was a first-year, just this brief glimpse of him in action told me he was quite capable himself. He probably wouldn’t be the kind of opponent I could subdue all that easily, if I were to face off against him. And because I had only gotten a glimpse of him in action, I couldn’t predict how things would go if he really went all out. Ryuuen had probably tried to stop Ishizaki from casually throwing down against Housen because he determined that engaging in a simple fistfight would put them at a disadvantage. This was one hell of a new student we were dealing with.“All right, I’ll stop. My business is all taken care of. Let’s go, Nanase,” said Housen.', '“That is a wise choice,” replied Nanase.Housen, seemingly satisfied with everything else except for the lack of a fight, shot one last look at Ryuuen.“If you get down on your knees for me, I don’t mind pairin’ up with ya. Whaddya say, Ryuuen-paisen?”“Sorry, dude, but I only work with human beings. Can’t say I got any plans of teamin’ up with a wild gorilla.”“Oh, well, that’s too bad,” said Housen.However, this whole ordeal wasn’t over yet. Aside from Housen and Nanase, there was one other first-year present who had been observing the entire situation. Perhaps Housen was upset with this other student, because he turned his attention to him at the end.“Hey, you just gonna hide and watch, punk?” sneered Housen.', '“Do you know the proverb ‘a wide man keeps away from danger’?” replied the student, fending off Housen’s glare with an eloquent response. “Making friendly conversation is fine, but it wouldn’t be beneficial for you to cause a ruckus here, Housen-kun. At any rate, I think you ought to withdraw for the time being. Am I wrong?”At the same time, the boy gave Housen what could be interpreted as friendly advice, an adult showed, too.“What are you doing, Housen?” he asked.This lone man, clad in a suit, seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, as if to put a stop to all this tumultuous situation. Many of the second-years who had been standing by and watching the situation unfold had fled, returning to their own classrooms.', '“Housen, I understand you’re restless. But I’m also quite sure the school rules have been drilled so thoroughly into your head by now that it feels ready to explode,” said the adult.“Yeah, yeah, I know,” said Housen.“If you do understand, then hurry up and disperse. No\\xa0fighting in the hallways.” “That was hardly even a real fight, though,” snorted Housen.With a scornful chuckle, he thrust his hands into his pockets, and then turned around, making an unexpectedly easy decision to retreat. He then ordered Nanase to retreat as well.“Well, see you later, Horikita.”Housen purposefully dropped Horikita’s name before he left… Well, no. It might be more accurate to say he was addressing the whole of Class 2-D. “We apologize for the disturbance,” said Nanase, with a bow of her head.', 'With that apology, the situation seemed to have been more or less successfully contained. But, when Nanase lifted her head back up, she looked me right in the eyes right as she was leaving. It was the same look she’d given me when she first arrived on this floor. A probing look, almost as if she wanted to know something. However, as soon as I noticed her looking at me, she immediately averted her eyes, and chased after Housen.“I must apologize to you all. I’m terribly sorry. My students have caused you quite a bit of trouble,” the teacher apologized to Horikita as she stood by watching everything that happened.“No, it’s all right…” she replied.“Since we’re here, please allow me to briefly introduce myself. I am Shiba Katsunori and I will be overseeing Class 1-D. I’ve only just accepted a position here at this school. I look forward to getting to know you all,” said the teacher.', 'After giving us that brief self-introduction, Shiba-sensei left, following at Housen. Then, almost as if they were taking turns, the level-headed boy from earlier came up and bowed his head to us. “It would seem that my classmate Housen-kun has caused a great deal of trouble for you, our seniors. On behalf of the first-year students, I’d like to offer my humble apologies,” said the boy.Unlike Housen, he seemed to be quite a well-spoken student.“We first-year students still don’t understand these special exams very well. I apologize for the inconvenience this may cause you, but we would humbly appreciate any help. Thank you,” said the student.', 'After he had finished giving us his apologies and general salutations, the student, who was apparently named Yagami, looked as though he was about to leave himself. But then he seemed to notice something—a group of four girls from Class D who’d just returned from lunch. Matsushita, Kushida, Satou, and Mii-chan. Yagami looked at one member of the group, Kushida, with surprise on his face.“It seems there’s been quite a fuss. What happened, Horikita-san?” Though Kushida was clearly aware of Yagami’s presence in turn, she asked Horikita about what was going on, sounding quite curious. “Nothing that you all need to worry about,” said Horikita.“Oh, really?” After Horikita told them that it was nothing, Kushida and the other three girls started to head back towards the classroom.“Um, pardon me, but…you wouldn’t happen to be Kushida-senpai, by any chance, would you?” asked Yagami.', '“Hm?” replied Kushida, turning around to look at who’d addressed her. If he knew Kushida’s name, could he be an acquaintance of hers? Or so I thought, but…“Um, you are?” said Kushida.She gave him a puzzled look. There was no sign that she was familiar with him.“It’s me. Do you not recognize me? Well, I suppose that’s only natural that you wouldn’t. It’s Yagami Takuya,” he replied.Kushida thought on it for a while after hearing his name, but then seemed to suddenly remember. “Yagami… Ah! Wait! You’re that Yagami-kun?!”“Yes, I am most certainly that Yagami. It’s been quite a long time, hasn’t it?” “Wow, so you came to this school too, Yagami-kun. What an incredible coincidence!” “I never imagined I’d meet you again here, Kushida-senpai.”“You know each other?” asked Satou, curiously.', 'Kushida nodded. “Yes. But we hardly ever actually talked before. Anyway, his name is Yagami Takuya-kun. He always seemed incredibly smart. but since we were in different grades, we never said much more than hello to each other.”“So, do you know him too?” I asked, whispering in Horikita’s ear to get confirmation.“Nope, I don’t know him at all,” she replied immediately.“Well, you don’t seem very good at remembering the faces of your classmates, though.”“I won’t deny that. I didn’t exactly have time to pay attention to people I wasn’t interested in,” said Horikita.Apparently, Horikita didn’t recognize…no, it was more like he didn’t register in her mind at all. I supposed if you were the kind of person who treated your classmates that way, there was no way you’d remember students younger than you. ', 'Well, even if Kushida didn’t remember this boy, he’d probably never been able to forget her. It just went to show how captivating she was.“I can’t believe how lucky I am. To be able to go to the same school as the revered Kushida-senpai…” said Yagami.“Oh, no, that’s a bit much, I’m nothing special…” she replied humbly.However, if Yagami really had attended the same junior high as Kushida, then a few concerns came to mind. “Does this Yagami kid know about you know what?” I\\xa0whispered to Horikita.I was referring to Kushida’s past, of course. In junior high, Kushida had caused her own class to turn on itself and fall apart. As a result, she considered Horikita—who’d attended the same school back then and knew the truth about what happened—a bitter enemy. Kushida wanted to get rid of Horikita, considering it too dangerous for someone to know what she’d done to her class. ', 'If Yagami had attended the same junior high, it wouldn’t be a surprise if he knew about what happened, too, but…“It wouldn’t be strange if he did. That being said, there’s no guarantee that he does,” said Horikita.In that case, Yagami being here certainly wasn’t very comforting for Kushida. Since there were students in our grade level who’d attended the same schools before, I supposed it wasn’t out of the question for students’ former juniors to enroll, either. “I realize this is quite sudden, but I must say I would have neither complaints nor concerns if I were able to team up with someone like you, Kushida-senpai. Would you be willing to partner with me?” asked Yagami.', 'Even though he and Kushida had only just been reunited, he asked to become partners, extending his hand with a friendly smile on his face. Was this all to show that he knew nothing about her past? Or that even if he did know, it didn’t matter?“Are you really okay with partnering with me, though? I mean, Yagami-kun, perhaps it would be better if you partnered with someone more on your level academically?” said Kushida.Yagami Takuya had an extremely high academic ability rating of A. Nothing to scoff at. No wonder Kushida was being so humble. Horikita, who had her phone out, looked up his information in the OAA app while she stood next to me, and confirmed that he was high-ranked.“I don’t know my way around here at all. So, I’d like to partner with someone I trust,” said Yagami.', 'The app could give you an idea of a person’s academic ability, but not their nature. He must have decided it would be better to team up with an acquaintance who he could be sure would produce solid results.“Um, well, could you give me some time to think it over…?” Perhaps because she was wary of Yagami, or for some other reason, Kushida put his offer on hold for the time being.“Of course, that would be perfectly fine. I will hold off on partnering up with anyone else for a while, and await your reply, Kushida-senpai.” Yagami agreed to put the offer on hold, indicating he was fine to wait. Considering that his academic ability was A-rank, there was no need for him to rush out and find a partner. ', '“Damn, that must be nice. If it were me, I would’ve partnered up without a second thought…” Sudou seemed jealous of Kushida’s ability to put an offer on hold. That made sense, considering his ranking was only E+.“In that case, you should work harder,” said Horikita.“Yeah… I’ll definitely improve my scores,” he answered.It wasn’t a mean-spirited comment. Sudou was envious because he had a desire to improve himself. I distanced myself from Horikita and the others for a moment because I saw Haruka beckoning me to come over. The rest of Ayanokouji Group all stood a short distance away: Akito, Keisei, and Airi. “H-he was super scary, wasn’t he?”The first thing I heard after joining them was Airi’s first impression of Housen. ', '“Sure seems there’s a bunch of troublemakers like Sudou-kun and Ryuuen-kun in this year’s batch of new students, huh?” Haruka sounded somewhat exasperated after having watched the entire commotion play out.Standing beside her was Akito. He remained motionless, staring fixedly at the spot in the hall where Housen once stood.“What’s the matter, Miyacchi?” asked Haruka.“A seriously scary dude has come to our school. Let’s just say things are probably gonna get rocky from here on out. That dude’s… Well, he’s so tough that even Sudou or Ryuuen can’t take him on,” said Akito.“Wait, hold up. Don’t tell me you know this guy too, Miyachi. Do you?” asked Haruka.“I never, like, met him in person or anythin’. But Ryuuen and Housen are both pretty big celebrities back where I’m from,” said Akito.It seemed Akito had lived somewhere close to the junior high schools that Ryuuen and Housen had attended.', '“Anyway, there used to be this gang leader at my school… The short version of the story is that this guy was a really tough-looking badass who was supposed to be really good in a fight. But one day, he just suddenly vanished. It caused a huge uproar. Then, right after he disappeared, I heard he’d wound up in the hospital after getting the crap beaten out of him in a one-on-one fight with some dude named Housen, who was on a rampage. This Housen had apparently just started at our junior high. He was a whole two years younger than the other\\xa0guy.”“G-gang leader? Dang, that’s like somethin’ straight out of a manga about bad dudes… That’s a little scary,” said Haruka.“The place I used to live in has been pretty infamous for attracting all sorts of riff raff for a long time now,” said Akito. “Oh, wow…” Haruka looked a little bit perplexed to hear this string of unfamiliar words from Akito.', '“And just like that, Housen went around all the junior high schools in the area, one after another, tightening his grip on all of ’em,” said Akito.“Ryuuen-kun’s pretty infamous too, isn’t he? But it seems like they’ve never met before,” said Haruka.“I get the feeling that’s ’cause they just never happened to run into each other,” said Akito.“By the way, did you used to be a bad dude yourself, Miyachi?” asked Haruka.“I… I quit doing that kinda stuff. These days I’m tryin’ to be a proper student.” “So, you were a delinquent.” “…I had a bad temper all the way up into my second-year of junior high. Since then, I’ve focused everything into archery,” said Akito.“But that means you really used to be a bad kid, though, right?” asked Haruka.Akito scratched his head in annoyance as Haruka, strangely enough, continued to press the matter.“So? What’s wrong with that?” he shot back.', '“No, actually, like…I think it’s kinda fine? If anything, I think that means you’ve got a pretty cool past. Don’t ya think?” said Haruka.“It ain’t cool at all,” said Akito.I was guessing the reason he knew so much about fighting was because he used to be that sort of person. You could certainly tell by looking at him that he had nerves of steel and quick reflexes.“I mean, since you were a former bad kid yourself, couldn’t you just give Housen a taste of his own medicine if necessary?” asked Haruka.“Quit jokin’ around. Even if I do fight somebody, I choose my opponents carefully. And I especially wouldn’t wanna fight Housen, for sure,” said Akito.', 'Akito was raising the white flag before the fight even happened. He was saying that less as an admission of his own weakness, though, and more due to recognizing Housen’s strength. Ibuki also had a certain degree of proficiency when it came to hand-to-hand combat, and she hadn’t been able to land a single hit. There was just an overwhelming difference in their physiques. And she wasn’t a match for him when it came to speed either.4.3\\xa0', 'AFTER CLASS ENDED, I was approached by Horikita, just like yesterday. As we were about to leave the classroom together, Sudou insisted on accompanying us as well. Horikita tried to refuse him, but just like last time, she seemed to be won over by his eagerness to help until he found a partner of his own. She let him come along on the condition that him taking time to help her wouldn’t interfere with his club activities or his studies. It was certainly surprising for Horikita to be so kind, or perhaps I should say accepting.', 'But I supposed there was a good reason for her allowing him to come. There were about ten days left until the special exam. Considering how exceptionally difficult the written exam was going to be, it was a good idea to secure a time and place where you’d be able to concentrate on your studies, even if just for a little while. But if Sudou was constantly worrying about what Horikita was up to, he wouldn’t be able to concentrate. It was clear to see that Horikita wanted to find a partner for Sudou as soon as possible, so that he could have time to devote himself to his studies. Horikita understood Sudou Ken very well—except for one particularly important thing. Namely, Sudou’s feelings for Horikita. She hadn’t recognized that there was a reason, deep down, why he just wanted to be by her side.', 'Of course, I wasn’t going to deliberately point out what was an important driving force for Sudou. Instead of heading toward the first-year classrooms, Horikita decided to head towards Keyaki Mall, perhaps because some first-years had caused quite a bit of trouble after coming up to our floor today during lunch. She was being careful to ensure a comparable incident didn’t take\\xa0place.Or maybe it was the problem child Housen, from Class 1-D, who had caused Horikita to change her mind. I supposed we’d find out soon enough. As soon as we entered the mall, Sudou stuck the little finger of his left hand in his ear to try and block out some of the sound, seeming a little irritated by the noise. He then gave his honest thoughts on the new students we saw out and about in front of us.“Man, I gotta say it’s loud in here, dude. Guess that’s ’cause of the first-years kickin’ up a ruckus and all.”', '“There certainly are quite a lot of students around,” replied Horikita.They were all over the place, chatting away happily, discussing things like what they wanted to buy or what they wanted to eat.“And yet we’re all seriously lookin’ for partners over here,” huffed Sudou.Wasting day after day trying to decide on a partner wasn’t good for either the second-years or the first-years. However, there was one particularly huge point of separation between the first- and second-years. That was the difference in our perception of the special exams. Very few of the new students felt a keen sense of urgency, just like the ones we’d seen yesterday after class. This fact was even more apparent when we set foot outside the school building.“It’s no wonder. I mean, it was the same for us, back when we were the new kids,” I replied.“Yeah, that’s true…” said Sudou.', 'With the hefty sum of money deposited into their accounts right after they had enrolled here, the new students were spending day after day in pursuit of idle amusement. Even if they were in Class A, it hardly made a difference. Regardless of how they were using their points, the fact was that they were all enjoying what this school had to offer to the absolute fullest. The most annoying thing of all, though, was the fact that there was a difference in the penalties we faced and the ones the new students did. We faced expulsion, while all they stood to lose were three months’ worth of Private Points. “Look at ’em, not a care in the world, man,” said Sudou.“I wouldn’t be talking if I were you, Sudou-kun. Have you forgotten what you were like a year ago?” said Horikita.“N-no, I didn’t forget or anythin’… I’ve been doin’ a lot of soul searchin’,” said Sudou.', 'Probably because he was the first student in our class to be faced with the real threat of being expelled. The relief measure that we had utilized at the time was no longer available to us, of course. The privilege of being beginners had already been used up.“For the time being, let’s try talking with a group of people,” said Horikita, spotting a group of three first-year guys sitting on a bench, chatting and laughing among themselves.Their names were Kaga, Mikami, and Shiratori. They were all students in Class 1-D and all had an academic ability ranking of B- or better. Before calling out to these students, Horikita had pulled up their information in the app, just to be sure. It seemed she hadn’t changed her mind about going after students from Class 1-D, after all.“Excuse me, do you have a moment?” asked Horikita.“…What is it?” replied one of the students.', 'They could probably tell just by glancing at us that they were dealing with upperclassmen. The joyful expressions quietly faded from their faces and were quickly replaced with looks of caution. “We’re looking for partners for the upcoming special exam. Have you found partners yourselves yet?” she asked.“Oh, uh, no. We still haven’t partnered up with anyone yet,” said one of the students.“If you’d like, we’d be happy to talk to you about partnering up,” said Horikita.“Yeah, we’d definitely be okay with that. Right?” said one of the students.After hearing Horikita’s proposal, the three of them nodded in response, almost as if they had discussed matters in advance. We got an unexpectedly good vibe from their response, and it seemed like they had relaxed their guard a little bit. Sudou looked surprised, like he could hardly believe how positive they were acting.', '“However, while I’m very sorry to say this, our top priority right now is to find—”“Partners who can help out the students with poor grades to prevent them from being expelled, right?” said one of the students, finishing Horikita’s sentence.It seemed that idea had already spread among the new students.“Yes. If you understand that already, then this discussion will be quick,” said Horikita.“Um, well… so, you’d like… one of us to team up with Sudou-senpai?” asked one of the students.They’d also checked out our profiles on their phones, which was why they had no hesitation in talking with us.“Yes. He’s one of the students we’d like to find a partner for. There are many others, as well,” said Horikita.“Oh, okay, I see. Let’s see, Sudou-senpai has an academic ability ranking of E+, huh… That does sound quite difficult,” said the student.', 'He was being diplomatic, but it was still clear he was pointing out just how low Sudou’s academic ability ranking was. Even though what he said was true, Sudou seemed upset. Still, he barely managed to keep it together and not let his dissatisfaction show on his face.“Shiratori, you should be able to handle it just fine, right?”The other two students looked to Shiratori, who sat at the far-right end of the bench.“My academic ability ranking is A, at least for the time being,” said Shiratori. “Yes, so it seems. If you’re willing to partner with him, I would certainly not complain,” said Horikita.“In that case… how about this much?” Shiratori held out his hand with all five fingers up, making a proposal in return.For a moment, Horikita didn’t understand what he was suggesting, so she looked back at Sudou and me.', '“My oh my. You want to partner up, right? If so, I should think something like this would be obvious. No?” said Shiratori.When Horikita heard that, she understood what he meant. “…I suppose you’re referring to Private Points.”“Of course. I mean, if someone like myself were to team up with a smart student, I could shoot for the top spot. Since I’ll be giving up a chance at getting the top-tier rewards by partnering with a student with a low academic ranking, it’s only natural that I ask for something in return,” said Shiratori.“Say what? You want points from us?! And you’re askin’ for fifty thousand…? Dude, that’s way too much,” said Sudou.For someone like Sudou, who was constantly short on funds every day, that was an extraordinary number of points to ask for.“Senpai, please stop joking around. There’s no way I could accept fifty-thousand,” said Shiratori.“Huh?” said Sudou.', '“I meant five hundred thousand. If you can give me five hundred thousand, I’ll happily partner up with you right here and now,” said Shiratori.“F-five hundred thousand?!” shouted Sudou.“It would be quite difficult for you if a student got expelled from your class, right? We’ve been doing a bit of research ourselves, you see,” said Shiratori.Apparently, this year’s batch of new students were quite different from how we’d been last year. They had already begun to understand how this school worked, and on top of that, they understood their value. Between our grade level and theirs, it was difficult to tell which of us were the seniors and which the juniors. Looking at the situation we were in, it could easily be interpreted the other way around.', '“It’s certainly natural to want some kind of remuneration if you’re being asked to partner with someone with a low academic ability ranking,” said Horikita.“H-hey, Suzune! I ain’t got five hundred large though, y’know?” said Sudou.“I know that. Be quiet for a minute,” said Horikita.The three first-year students wore sarcastic, wry smiles on their faces after hearing Sudou carelessly divulge his financial circumstances. “It’s only natural to want points, yes. However, is chasing after short-term desires really a good idea?” said Horikita.“Meaning?” asked Shiratori, speaking as a representative of the three students.', '“Meaning that if you ingratiate yourselves with us here and now, we might be able to provide help to you down the road, in similar situations,” said Horikita, explaining to them that it would be to their advantage later if they were to exchange in some give-and-take with us in a form other than Private Points.“Well, putting you aside, Horikita-senpai, since you have an A ranking, I can’t really imagine having Sudou-senpai or Ayanokouji-senpai there would really be of any help to us. Wouldn’t you say?” said Shiratori.“That’s not necessarily true. This school isn’t just about academics. There are times when you’ll need physical ability, too,” said Horikita.That was especially applicable to Sudou, as he was the only student in our grade level who had an A+ in physical ability. Horikita had been intending to use that as a weapon in her arsenal for this negotiation, but…', '“I know that. But still, you’re just Class D in the end, right? If we were to ingratiate ourselves within anyone, it would be Class A or Class B,” said Shiratori calmly, having apparently come to an objective conclusion.Seeing that, Horikita probably understood. “…I see. So that’s how it is.”Considering how smoothly they handled themselves after hearing our offer and the number of points they came back with as a counter-offer, we didn’t need to think too hard about what was going on here.“Wh-what do you mean by that?” asked Sudou.“Before you arrived, we were approached by senior students from other classes,” said Shiratori.“And they told you not to sell your academic abilities for cheap. Right?” asked Horikita.“Yes. Please understand that we won’t partner with you if you do not offer us suitable compensation in points,” said Shiratori.', 'In the face of Shiratori and his classmates, Horikita kept her composure, and then continued talking.“It’s certainly true that you shouldn’t sell yourself cheaply, in that case. However, were you really approached by other students from our grade, though?” said Horikita.“What do you mean by that?” asked Shiratori. He looked irritated, like his pride as an A-ranked student had been wounded.“You’re also in Class D, just like us. I can’t imagine students from higher-level classes would have approached you so casually,” said Horikita.Horikita was bluffing. As long as you had an elevated level of academic ability, you’d be useful to have around in this exam, regardless of whether you were in Class D. She was trying to confirm who had talked to them, and how much they had said. Perhaps because Shiratori’s pride had been called into question, he rebutted this in a somewhat abrasive tone.', '“It’s true, though. We were invited by Hashimoto-senpai from Class 2-A. On top of that, we were approached by students from Class 2-C, who offered us quite a few points to partner up with them. Isn’t that right?” said Shiratori, glancing at his friends, who both immediately voiced their agreement.“We’re not the only ones, either. Most of the smart kids have been approached,” added Shiratori.Just as Horikita had calculated, Class 2-A and Class C had gone with the idea of trying to buy students out.“I see… In that case, I suppose we cannot meet your expectations right now,” said Horikita.“Oh, but as long as you give us points, we will not refuse you. We intend to see how things go for about a week. If you were to offer us five hundred thousand points during that time, we’d be happy to partner with anyone, even Sudou-senpai,” said Shiratori.', 'Five hundred thousand points to prevent someone from getting expelled. A large sum to be sure, but if you looked at it from another angle, you could say it was the price of your safety. However, we couldn’t make a snap decision here. Nor did we intend to.“By the way… How many points did Hashimoto-kun and the others offer you for your cooperation?” asked Horikita.She was hoping to know the specific number of points that were offered, but Shiratori and his buddies weren’t that naïve. “We promised not to say. All I will say is that for five hundred thousand points, we will help you,” said Shiratori.“I understand. I will take that into consideration. However, we would like to ask you for one favor. Would you be willing to introduce us to some of your fellow students in Class D?” asked Horikita.“Introduce?” Shiratori repeated.', '“We’ve already prepared to work with your class, to a certain extent. But approaching each person individually and explaining the same thing over and over would take up a lot of time and energy. If possible, we’d like to gather all of you in one place and have a more concrete discussion then,” said Horikita.She had hinted at the idea of forming a partnership, but didn’t say specifically what that would look like. The three students exchanged glances, though they all looked uncomfortable about something.“That’s… Well, asking us to do something like that might be a little difficult… Right, guys?”“Yeah. If we go ahead and do something like that\\xa0without getting permission, Housen-kun will probably get mad at us. Don’t you think?”The name ‘Housen’ came up in the conversation they were having among themselves.', '“I’m sorry senpai, but could you please ask someone else to handle that…?” asked Shiratori.It seemed Housen was the one who held Class 1-D’s leashes, after all. Horikita, sensing that the mood had clearly changed, decided not to pursue the matter further. “Thank you. I will call on you again if the need arises,” she\\xa0said.“A-all right. We’ll be waiting,” said Shiratori.We walked away from the bench and started heading towards the café on the second floor. I secretly peeked back at them as we left, and saw that Shiratori, phone in hand, seemed to be hurriedly calling someone.“We got some information, but it’s hard to say that we made any actual progress. The only thing we know for sure is that if we were to offer them an absolutely absurd five hundred thousand points, they would agree to cooperate with us on the spot,” said Horikita.', '“They’re totally tryin’ to take advantage of us and price gouge, makin’ those ridiculous demands,” huffed Sudou.“It certainly is a ridiculous amount they’re asking for, yes. But it’s also true that they have no reason to sell their talents on the cheap,” said Horikita.Even more so if they were ranked A in academic ability. This was certainly a much more direct way of earning points than shooting for the one-hundred-thousand-point reward for getting high marks on the exam.“So in the end, the only way for me to save myself is by payin’ somebody a bunch of Private Points?” asked Sudou.“It’s certainly getting harder and harder to say for sure that there are any students out there who will help you for free.” ', 'The notion that points would be the key to forming partnerships had already spread. It would be best if we assumed it wasn’t just Shiratori and his friends who believed so, but rather that their entire grade level knew to ask for points in exchange for partnerships. I was sure we could safely say this was part of Sakayanagi and Ryuuen’s strategy, too. Normally, doing things in exchange for points was frowned upon. Such transactions brought with them a sense of shame, and so, they were usually done in secret. But by conducting a large-scale buy out operation, they had essentially made the new students realize that offering their services for free would be losing out. ', 'Even so, there was something that bothered me about the conversation we just had with Shiratori and his classmates earlier. Though they had already been approached by students from other classes, they’d said that they were going to wait a week. Even if they were just waiting that long so they could try and fish for more points, I was concerned by the fact that all three of them had seemed to be in agreement about their course of action from the very beginning. I would have thought students would have wanted to seek reassurance by finding a partner right away. Was it just that those particular three happened to be bullheaded? Or perhaps… “Even if we continue to ask around randomly like this, we’ll probably keep getting the same answers, won’t we?” I told them.', 'Scoping out Class 1-D was fun and all, but the real problem came after that. What Shiratori and his friends said about Housen getting angry with them if they acted without permission stuck in my mind. Judging from the way Shiratori and his friends talked, I was certain that Housen Kazuomi oversaw their entire class. “Housen likely gave his classmates some instructions,” I added. “He probably told them something like, ‘Hey, you can team up with anybody you want, but you can only make a snap decision to team up if they offer you five hundred thousand points. If they don’t make that offer, put their request to team up on hold, even if they’re from Class A,’ or something like that.”“But wait, if they do that, won’t that mean Class 1-D gets left behind?” asked Sudou.“I’m saying they’re planning on that happening. They intend to be the last ones,” I replied.“Huh? I don’t get it,” said Sudou.', '“It’s only we second-year students who are afraid of getting hit with the penalty for not finding a partner. He was probably thinking that he can hold that over our heads and use it to rip us off for as many Private Points as possible toward the end,” I told him.If all the honors students outside of Class 1-D had already been bought up, we’d eventually have no choice but to shell out to get the ones from Class D to cooperate with us, whether we liked it or not. Even if that meant paying a million or two million.“It’s an incredibly rash strategy, made with absolutely no thought about what’ll happen in the future,” said Horikita.“Tell me again, how exactly do you plan on fighting this?” I said.', 'We’d already figured out what Class 1-D was planning to do. So, having taken that into account, I wanted to know what Horikita was thinking. Would she try and force herself in between what Class 2-A and Class C were starting to do right now, with their extreme buy-out strategies? Or would she perhaps adopt a strategy more like what Ichinose was doing, forming relationships built on trust by accepting many lower-ranked students, regardless of what class they were in, and appealing to the honors students for their cooperation?“I decided to set three goals when we heard the outline for this particular special exam,” said Horikita.“Three goals?” asked Sudou.He seemed to be interested in what she was about to say, since he was leaning in closer.“The most important of which is to not let anyone from our class get expelled. That goes without saying,” said Horikita.', '“Yeah, for sure,” replied Sudou, nodding.“The second is to shoot for third place or better in overall points, in the competition against other classes,” said Horikita.“Wait, third? You mean we’re throwin’ away our shot of going after first or second right from the get-go?” asked Sudou.“No one said anything about throwing away our shot of going after those places. I said third place or better,” said Horikita.True enough, saying she was hoping for third place or better technically included first- and second-place. But that didn’t seem to be precisely what she meant, and it most likely had something to do with her third goal.“My third goal is to avoid participating in these money games. I plan to do battle with those three principles in mind,” said Horikita.“Huh…? B-but…” stammered Sudou.', '“I understand what you want to say. Namely, that if we’re not going to compete using Private Points, then we have no hope of winning this thing. However, even if we try and compete using the points that we have, the reward isn’t worth the risk. Even if we do finish in first place overall, we will only gain fifty Class Points. Meaning that over the course of a year, our class would only get a little over two million Private Points,” said Horikita.If we got five thousand points per person per month, (excluding the deposit that we got in April, which had already passed) and multiplied that amount by the remaining eleven months, then we’d end up with two million, one hundred and forty-five thousand Private Points.', '“And if we pay five hundred thousand points per person, that means we’d be in the red after paying for five people. We can’t possibly be so naïve as to think that we could win this thing just by getting four or so first-years who have an academic ability ranking of A, right?” said Horikita.Even if we were to carry that into the next two years—that is, until we graduated—it would still only be four million, four hundred and eighty-five thousand Private Points. Which covered a maximum of eight recruits. Moreover, this was all based on the supposition that not only could we assuredly draw in those students at five hundred thousand at most, but also, that we would be getting first place in the overall rankings by grade level. Considering the risks, it would likely be far more efficient for us to simply wait for an upcoming special exam and use our Private Points then.', '“Private Points and Class Points are not equal. I’m well aware that there is more to it than just what we get in return. However, I think that even if we do pump all our points into this test, we’d only have a slim chance of winning, so we shouldn’t try and push it. Am I wrong, Ayanokouji-kun?” asked Horikita.“Not at all. Your decision is the right one,” I replied.The difference in overall academic ability between us and Class 2-A had been clear from the start. If we wanted to win overall, I couldn’t really imagine we’d gain much of an advantage from bringing in eight students. Of course, Horikita was resourceful. She would probably consider paying out Private Points if there were students who were willing to partner up for fifty or a hundred thousand. It was just that she didn’t want this battle to come down to what was in our bank accounts.', '“In order to achieve those three goals, I still think we should try to negotiate with Class 1-D, after all,” said Horikita. “Wh-why though? Weren’t all the kids in their class told by Housen not to team up with us for anythin’ less than five hundred large?” said Sudou.“As far as the honors students are concerned, yes, that’s true. However, there are students in their class who have an academic ability ranking of C or below, too. What do you think would happen if they were neglected?” asked Horikita.“What would happen…?” repeated Sudou.“Students who should normally have been fine would also receive penalties, and their position would be thrown into question,” I replied.Horikita nodded at what I said, and then continued from there.', '“There’s no way those students would willingly give up the Private Points they could get every month. Which means at some point, Housen-kun will have no choice but to abandon his current stance,” said Horikita.Even if all the honors students in 1-D tried selling themselves for five hundred thousand points, the rest of the students in their class couldn’t do the same. Putting aside the issue of whether second-year students would get expelled or not, Housen would fall behind in the battle between the first-years.“If he’s looking for a way to win, there will definitely be an opening that we can exploit,” said Horikita.It seemed she was intent on dealing with Class 1-D then, the class that everyone else wanted to avoid.“That being said, it would be dangerous for all thirty-nine of us to try and engage with Housen-kun’s class. We need to minimize the risk as much as possible,” said Horikita.', 'If our negotiations failed, then it would be the students with less academic skill who would be in trouble.“Considering that the exam period has only just begun, I suppose it’s not strange some kids are asking for entirely unreasonable conditions to partner up,” said Horikita.“Well, I hope you’re right… I mean, as far as I’m concerned though, I kinda doubt there’s anyone out there for me,” said Sudou.“In any case, the only way we’ll find gifted partners is to reach out to a lot of people,” said Horikita.As we were waking up the steps to the café on the second floor though, we heard a voice come from behind us.“Hey! If you’re looking for a gifted partner, I’m right here, y’know?”', 'When we turned around, we saw a lone female student looking over at us, with a big grin on her face, from ear to ear. As soon as our eyes met, she slowly walked up the steps. Horikita was the first one of us to let her suspicions show on her face.“Were you eavesdropping on us?” she asked.“Oh, gosh, no, senpai, I just shouted out because I only happened to hear what you were saying is all. And umm…” The girl spoke without looking over at Sudou or me, keeping her gaze locked onto Horikita. “Senpai, what’s your name and academic ability ranking?”“… My name’s Horikita. I’m from Class 2-D. My academic ability score is A-. What of it?” she asked.“Oh, wow, you’re smart!” replied the girl.“And your name is?”“I’m Ichika Amasawa. From Class 1-A. I’m the same as you, Horikita-senpai. I’ve got an A in academic ability.”', 'She looks like a girl who only cares about popularity, but is actually quite a smart student. Just to be sure, Horikita checked her information in the app.“If you want to shoot for the top, I’ll work with you. Okay?”Amasawa asked that question without even asking anything about our backgrounds. If students with A- and A ratings teamed up together, it certainly wouldn’t be impossible for them to get first place. As for Horikita, she had deliberately lowered her score for Sudou’s sake in the past, so if you took that fact into consideration, it wouldn’t be unfair to say she actually was an A, not an A-.', 'Though this was unexpected, Horikita could very well end up settling on a partner for herself, not Sudou or anyone else. This might be a coincidence, but a student with an academic ability ranking of A did just reach out to her. If Horikita were to say that she instead wanted Amasawa to partner with a student with a lower ranking, Amasawa might choose to walk away.“I sincerely appreciate the offer, but I’m actually not looking for a partner right now myself. Instead of partnering with me though, could I possibly ask you about partnering with him… With Sudou-kun?” asked Horikita.Horikita took that risk anyway, introducing the girl to Sudou. Though Sudou was a little perplexed by the situation, he gently bowed his head to Amasawa, giving her a proper greeting.“Uh, let’s see, what’s Sudou-senpai’s academic ability ranking?” said Amasawa.', '“E+. Certainly not a good grade, by any stretch,” said Horikita.‘Not good’ was putting it mildly. If anything, he was in the running for the lowest ranking in our entire grade.“I gotcha. So that means you’re looking for help, Horikita-senpai. You’re trying to find a partner for him so that he won’t get kicked out of school.” Amasawa, having grasped the situation, looked over at Sudou. “E+, huh. If we teamed up, forget about getting the top spot. We’d probably end up scoring a little under the middle of the road.”“Yes, that’s true. There’s hardly any advantage for you in it,” said Horikita.I wondered if Amasawa was going to bring up points now, but there was no sign she was going to do that.“Well, still, if you’re askin’ for help, I certainly wouldn’t mind lending you a hand,” said Amasawa.', 'Things were clearly looking much more favorable for us than how they’d gone with those three boys earlier. Amasawa then looked in my direction.“What about him? Is he looking for a partner too?” she asked.“His academic ability ranking is C. He’s not exactly a top priority for us. However, if Sudou-kun is a no-go for you, we’d still be very appreciative if you’d team up with Ayanokouji-kun, as a worst-case scenario,” said Horikita.“Wait, no, hold on—” I replied, cutting in.While this was probably a kind gesture on Horikita’s part, I had to put a stop to it. I couldn’t just decide upon a partner right now without thinking about it.“Is there something wrong with her?” asked Horikita.“No, it’s not like that, it’s—”', '“Oh, hey, wait a sec. I still haven’t said which one of them I’ll pair up with yet though, y’know?” Amasawa, seeing that the conversation was moving ahead without her actual consent on the matter, spoke up and put a stop to it.“Do you have any conditions you would need fulfilled for you to partner with either of these two, then?” asked Horikita.“Conditions, conditions, huh. Yeah, okay. I suppose I am entitled to at least that much, right?” said Amasawa.Horikita had decided to bring up the topic herself, to see if Amasawa had any conditions for a partnership. She hadn’t changed her basic policy of avoiding engaging in a spending competition with the other classes using Private Points, but if Amasawa’s price was low enough, there was room for consideration. I just prayed it wasn’t too high a price, like what Shiratori and his friends were asking for…', '“Well, I really like strong people, y’know,” said Amasawa, saying something that had absolutely nothing to do with this exam while wearing a devilish little grin.“What in the world are you talking about?” Horikita furrowed her brow suspiciously, having expected the topic of discussion to shift from studies to points.“Well, it’s like, I was racking my brain over what I should do for this exam and stuff. I was thinking, should I study super hard, team up with someone around A-rank like Horikita-senpai, and try and shoot for the top? …Or, like, should I kinda take it easy, just try and get through the exam? And if I’m going to take it easy in the test, I’d wanna team up with someone I like, you know what I mean?” said Amasawa.I supposed that was certainly preferable to working with someone you didn’t like or someone you didn’t care about at all.', '“I like strong guys,” added Amasawa, repeating what she had just said earlier. Horikita’s head spun as she tried to understand what Amasawa was saying.“Meaning… you’re asking if Sudou-kun is strong or not, then?” asked Horikita.“Right. And I’m not talking about, like, being mentally strong or anything. I’m asking about whether he’s physically strong. Well, I can tell easily enough that you do sports or stuff just from looking at your physique,” said Amasawa, pointing her finger at Sudou, a student who normally should be a non-entity to someone with an A in academic ability.Sudou was confident of his strength, so while he was somewhat shy about it, he nodded in agreement.“You wanna partner with me?” asked Amasawa, extending her hand and caressing Sudou’s cheek.“W-well, I mean, if I had an A in academics, then we’d be a lot better off though… Are you really okay with me?” said Sudou.', '“If you really are strong, then sure,” said Amasawa.She ran her thin fingertip along Sudou’s chest, mesmerizing him with her allure.“I-I’m strong,” he replied.“Well, I don’t dislike guys who are full of confidence,” said Amasawa.“What exactly do you mean, if he’s really strong?” Horikita, who had taken on the responsibility of getting Sudou situated, expressed her lack of understanding of what Amasawa was talking about.“It means what it sounds like. I like strong people who are good in a fight. That’s why I wanna partner up with someone strong,” said Amasawa.“In that case, I think Sudou-kun can measure up. I can vouch for his physical strength,” said Horikita.“Words aren’t enough for me, though. I’ll have to confirm it with my own eyes,” said Amasawa.“…With your own eyes?” asked Horikita.', '“I mean like, go out, round up a bunch of strong second-years, have ’em fight each other. And then I’ll partner up with the toughest one there,” said Amasawa.“Are you joking? There’s no way we could do something like that,” said Horikita.“Why not? Hey, I’ve been serious this whole time we’ve been talking, right?” Sudou, who couldn’t believe Amasawa was being serious either, spoke. “Let’s go, Suzune. Stayin’ here’s just a waste of time.”It sounded almost as though he was admonishing himself for falling for Amasawa’s charms, even if only for a moment.“Eh, I don’t really care if you just wanna pretend this conversation never happened,” said Amasawa.', 'She was saying that to her, this whole thing was nothing more than a little fun. She certainly didn’t have to go out of her way to partner up with an E+ ranked student, if she wanted. Considering the fact that Amasawa’s class and abilities were nothing to scoff at, she’d probably have no shortage of people willing to pay to be with her. Still, this might be fortunate for us, to a certain extent. If we agreed to her request, Sudou would gain the right to partner with a student with A-rank academic ability. And even if he didn’t end up getting to partner with her, we lost nothing.“You’re not saying this just to make fun of us, then? You’re really serious about this?” asked Horikita in response, a serious look in her eyes.“Of course I’m serious,” said Amasawa.“I see. In that case, I suppose we’ll take this seriously too, and hear you out,” said Horikita.“H-Hey, Suzune?” said Sudou.', '“Come on, it’s fine! I wanna team up with someone strong, after all,” said Amasawa.“All right. In that case, Sudou-kun, you should accept her offer,” said Horikita.“W-wait, hold up, Suzune. The school ain’t just gonna let us have a fight or whatever. Stuff’ll get pretty bad if we fight, won’t it? I mean like what happened last year, and at lunch, with that little tussle with that Housen dude. Right?” said Sudou.Last year, Sudou had gotten in a fight with several guys from Ryuuen’s class and it had turned into quite the problem. And just today, there had been a big commotion when Housen came by.“It’s certainly true that fighting isn’t exactly praiseworthy. But if both sides consent, there should be no issue. Don’t you think so, Ayanokouji-kun?” said Horikita.', 'I took a moment to consider what Horikita’s intentions were in asking me that question. If she was asking me if there was no issue with such a fight, then my answer would obviously be that yes, there would be issues. Win or lose, even if both parties agreed to fight and then started swinging, there was essentially no way that school administrators would approve of something that essentially amounted to a duel. However, Horikita had responded to Amasawa in a way that sounded like she was condoning the idea of such a brawl.“I suppose you’re right. If school officials heard talk of a fight, there’s no way they’d agree to let it happen. If the students involved all consent to the fight, however, it doesn’t seem like it’d be a huge issue.” I purposefully answered her back in a way that communicated I had no problem with it.“H-hey, Ayanokouji!” wailed Sudou.', '“On top of that, no matter who you picked from our grade level, no one would be able to beat Sudou-kun in a fight,” said Horikita.“Got that right,” I replied.Sudou didn’t understand what was going on, but Horikita and I were taking turns passing the baton back and forth to each other in this conversation. The important thing right now wasn’t to affirm the idea of actually having a fight. It was to prove that Sudou was the strongest—without actually having him fight anyone.', '“To be frank, Sudou-kun, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Think about it. Normally, it would be extremely difficult to pair you up with a student with A-rank academic ability. However, Amasawa-san has said that she’s willing to partner with you. Understand? On top of that, she’s agreeing to partner with you on the condition of you winning a fight. A test of strength. Something you’re better at than anyone else. You should take this deal without a second’s hesitation,” said Horikita.', 'There was no way a second-year student familiar with the school rules would carelessly agree to engage in a fight like this. On top of that, if their opponent was Sudou, the outcome was as clear as day. In other words…even if we agreed to her terms here and now, the fight might never actually end up taking place. And even in the off chance that someone did take the challenge, Sudou could put them down.“Ooh, nice! Nice! I’m gettin’ kind of excited!” Amasawa, having just enrolled here, naturally knew none of this. There was no way she could understand how different this place was from a normal junior high or high school.“But, could you promise us one thing, first? If no one shows up to this fight other than Sudou-kun, then you’ll agree to partner with him,” said Horikita, hoping to confirm an important part of the deal.', 'If Amasawa didn’t agree to that condition, this discussion would go any further.“Sure. I promise. If no challenger shows up, then he’ll win by default,” said Amasawa.After Amasawa gave us her word, Horikita nodded, apparently satisfied.“All right, Sudou-kun?” she asked, turning to Sudou.“…Sure. If you don’t have a problem with it, Suzune, then I don’t mind at all,” said Sudou, balling both his hands into fists and then smacking them together in front of him, hard.As far as Horikita was concerned, Amasawa’s proposal was both a product of chance and an invaluable opportunity.“Okey dokey, I’ll post a general message in the app for everyone to see. I’ll tell anyone who feels confident about their physical strength to shoot me a direct message before the end of the day if they wanna join in,” said Amasawa. ', '“Heh. No matter who shows up, I’ll take ’em.” Conveniently enough, Sudou didn’t seem to understand what Horikita was thinking. He was probably just getting excited over the idea of fighting somebody hand-to-hand.“Would it be all right if we select the location? We’d prefer not to unintentionally let things slip to the school,” said Horikita.“Yeah, sure. I think you guys would probably know more about that than me anyway. I’ll let you handle that part.” Amasawa must have finished composing her message, because she turned to us for a final confirmation before sending it out. “Okay, so once this goes out, we’ll have our little test of strength. That okay with you?”Horikita nodded back in response. Amasawa slowly looked over all three of us. Then she turned her phone’s screen off and put it back in her pocket.“Actually, let’s not, after all,” said Amasawa.', 'I had thought maybe she had a sudden change of heart, but that didn’t seem to be the case. Judging from the look on her face, we should assume that she had been testing us, trying to feel us out. However, both Horikita and Sudou were flustered by Amasawa’s abrupt change.“What’s wrong?” asked Horikita.“Even if I put out a message asking for people, it doesn’t seem like anyone would show up. Based on Sudou-senpai’s physique, and the way both Horikita-senpai and Ayanokouji-senpai are acting, I can tell he’s top dog in terms of strength in your grade level,” said Amasawa.', 'So she’d come to understand there was no need to go through the trouble of making people fight to compare them. It seemed the little act Horikita and I had put on, as well as Sudou’s natural reaction, had been even more effective than we had expected. If Amasawa had only noticed all this after she posted the message, Horikita probably wouldn’t have let her take it back. In order to not let Amasawa realize that we had been acting before, Horikita expressed her dissatisfaction. “Are you making fun of us?” “No way, it’s nothing like that, really. It’s just, like, it’s no fun when the outcome’s so obvious. I just want to see it with my own eyes and make sure he’s the strongest. So please don’t get all mad at me, senpai.”Amasawa pressed her forefinger against her lips, lost in thought for a moment.“I’ll still give you a chance though, so come on, forgive me?” she added.', 'Horikita was trying to stay in control of the conversation, but kept getting knocked off balance by Amasawa’s peculiar approach. It seemed she didn’t jive so well with people like Amasawa.“Well, I guess besides strong guys, I like guys who can cook,” said Amasawa.“Cook?” said Horikita.Amasawa’s newest suggestion was once again something completely unrelated to the special exam.“So, Sudou-senpai, right? Would you make me a home-cooked meal? Something, like, super extra yummy?” said Amasawa.“A h-home-cooked meal?!” stammered Sudou.Sudou, who had been brimming with confidence just moments ago, now seemed overcome with shock after hearing her unexpected request.“I mean, it being tasty is a prerequisite, of course. It’s gotta be good. But you also have to make something that I specifically request,” said Amasawa.“W-wait, I ain’t ever cooked a meal in my life—”', '“Is that so? Well, I guess that means I take back giving you a chance, hmm,” replied Amasawa, cutting him off.Horikita jumped into the conversation, not wanting to let this opportunity pass us by. “Can I do it then, in Sudou-kun’s place?”“Nope. I told you before, didn’t I? I said I like guys who can cook. ’Sides, if the guy I’m partnering up with can’t cook, then there’s no point in partnering with them at all,” said Amasawa. Meaning it didn’t matter how well Horikita could cook. If you were a girl, Amasawa wasn’t interested.', '“Well, if Sudou-senpai is no good, why not give up on him and try to find a classmate who can cook? Oh, is that because even if you did go out and find someone in a hurry, I still wouldn’t be partnering with Sudou-senpai then, hm?” said Amasawa, flashing a devilish grin. “Maybe you should work on turning Sudou-senpai into a master cook. Of course, I gotta wonder if you can really do that in time, huh. I am pretty popular, you know. If you don’t hurry, I’ll probably find a partner.”', 'That wasn’t just a hollow threat. She would probably find a partner in the not-too-distant future. There were many exceptionally talented students other than Horikita in our grade level. There was no need for Amasawa to deliberately take on the risk of partnering with the likes of Sudou. If anything, this was nothing more than a playful whim on her part. If she changed her mind even a little, that would be the end of it. But a classmate who had poor grades and was a guy who was good at cooking? No one else came to mind at the moment. In that case, this request from Amasawa might just be a no-go for Class D. Giving up on her and going after other students would probably be a better use of our time. When Amasawa saw we weren’t giving her an answer, she went on to add something else.', '“Okay. Well, how about I give you a little special treatment? I did want to partner with a guy who’s good at cooking, but… If you can satisfy my taste buds, I’d be willing to team up with a good fighter like Sudou-senpai,” said Amasawa.She was offering us a compromise. Amasawa wanted to partner up with a guy who was a good fighter or a good cook. In that case, we could certainly satisfy her.“I guess it would be like teaming up with a good cook and a good fighter at the same time, huh?” she added.Amasawa was saying she would be willing to partner up with Sudou as long as another guy could satisfy her. I\\xa0wondered how Horikita would respond…? But the problem was that I couldn’t really think of a student who fit the bill. We also seriously lacked the time necessary to teach someone how to cook. ', '“Ayanokouji-kun. If I recall, you once boasted to me that you’re quite the skilled cook, didn’t you?” said Horikita.What in the world was Horikita thinking, asking me a question like that so openly? I had never once told her anything of the sort, much less boasted about it. While it would have been easy for me to deny her assertion, it seemed necessary for me to play along and make sure our stories matched. The chances of Sudou being able to partner with a student with an A in academic ability weren’t exactly high.“It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that cooking is my one and only area of expertise,” I replied.“Yes, quite. Well then, if you’ll permit it, Amasawa-san, how about Ayanokouji-kun?” asked Horikita.', '“As long as it’s a guy, I don’t care who. But is he really a good cook, though? I mean, you can go ahead and say whatever you want, talk is cheap, but I’m going to judge you pretty harshly, okay?” said Amasawa.“That’ll be fine, of course. Isn’t that right?” said Horikita, turning to me.“Yeah, I guess so.”As soon as I agreed to it, Amasawa immediately clapped her hands together.“Okay! How about we get this show on the road and you show me what you can do?” Things were moving way too quickly. However, what Amasawa had just said seemed like she was both sealing the deal and giving us an ultimatum. She wanted to avoid giving me enough of a grace period that I could go learn how to cook. She wanted to ascertain whether I really was as good as I claimed to be. ', 'Since Horikita needed to make sure Amasawa believed her lie, she couldn’t go ahead and say yes to her request. Even if I were to go ahead and cook for Amasawa now, with my current level of skill, it was clear it wouldn’t amount to much. And even if Amasawa didn’t actually judge me that harshly, I would probably still end up failing to meet her standards.', '“While we’d love to, could you possibly give us a little time? Ayanokouji-kun and I are in the process of reaching out to first-year students to find partners for our classmates. Aside from Sudou-kun, there are many other students who need help. If the other classes beat us to the punch, then we’ll really be hurting. Even at this very moment, our rivals are scrambling to find partners,” said Horikita, explaining our situation to Amasawa, to see if she understood what we were dealing with. “If possible, we’d like to put this on hold until after class on Friday.”She rejected Amasawa’s request to have me cook something for her right away. On top of that, she asked if we could postpone things for a couple of days, suggesting we could make some time on the weekend. ', '“I see, I see. Well, I suppose you’re right, it wouldn’t be good for little ol’ me to take up all your time myself.” Then Amasawa offered a new proposal. “I’d be all right doing it later tonight, though. What about that? That wouldn’t be a problem, would it?” “A first-year student going to a second-year student’s dorm in the middle of the night—and a boy’s room, to boot—would most certainly be improper,” said Horikita.“Oh, I see. But waitin’ until the weekend is kinda tough for me. And I’d lose the chance to partner up with any other of my senpai then… Right?” Just as I’d thought, Horikita’s suggestion to wait until the weekend wasn’t going to fly. Amasawa came back with a pretty harsh reply this time.', '“But since this is kinda, like, fate or something, I’ll give you just one day. If you tell me you can’t cook something for me tomorrow after class, I guess we’ll just have to pretend this whole thing never happened,” said Amasawa.That was probably the very last compromise she was willing to make. She was drawing a hard line. I got the sense that if we got too greedy, Amasawa would immediately pull back. If Horikita didn’t slip up in her bargaining, then…“You’re right. I certainly cannot deny that my request would place quite a burden on you. And besides, I’m sure you don’t want to carelessly give us time to practice cooking. Right?” said Horikita.“Oh, gosh, no, I didn’t think that far ahead or anything,” said Amasawa.“…All right. Can we seal the deal then, with these terms?” asked Horikita.', 'We only had one day of preparation time. However, if we didn’t stick to those terms, we weren’t going to be able to hold onto Amasawa. What Horikita was agreeing to could be interpreted as desperate measures taken under pressure of necessity, but she signaled that she agreed to the amended proposal all the same.“It’s settled, then.” Amasawa agreed readily, having no objection to meeting up tomorrow after class like she’d suggested earlier.“However, that’s as long as you don’t take back what you said, like you did earlier when we were talking about having a fight,” said Horikita.“Okay. I promise. If I determine that his cooking skills are legit, then I’ll team up with Sudou-senpai right then and there.” Although it was just a verbal promise, Amasawa nodded and answered honestly.“Please, I’m beggin’ ya, Ayanokouji. Use your cookin’ skills to get me a partner, somehow!” wailed Sudou.', 'Given the situation, I figured I’d play along. But I never imagined things would turn out like this.“Okay, so, how about we meet up in front of Keyaki Mall at four thirty tomorrow after class? Would that be okay, Ayanokouji-senpai?” asked Amasawa.“At the mall? Not at the dorms?” I asked in return.“What I’m gonna ask you to make is a secret! And besides, you’re gonna have to buy the ingredients and stuff to make it, right?” said Amasawa.I see. So she was going to judge me on everything, starting with what I bought.“Is it okay if I accompany him too?” asked Horikita, probably looking to offer me advice, so that our ruse wouldn’t be discovered.But our opponent wasn’t going to let that slide so easily.“Nope! You could give him advice, by like, signaling with your eyes and stuff. I’m going to be reaaaaaally strict with how I judge!” said Amasawa.']\n"

      "Capítulo 4: Estes novos anos de primeiro ano não são nada mas são problemas. Havia dezenas de estudantes de primeiro e segundo ano que se juntavam no ginásio. A maioria das pessoas não eram de segundo ano, mas eram de primeiro ano. Suponho que muitos estudantes viam este encontro como uma oportunidade importante. Como eu não sabia quem eram os anos de primeiro ano no momento mesmo, decidi começar por descobrir que estudantes de segundo ano participavam neste evento. O líder da Classe A, Sakayanagi, não estava em nenhum sítio a ser visto. E embora não sabia se eu poderia chamar-lhe exatamente um stand-in para ela, vi Hashimoto Masayoshi. Sakayanagi tinha uma deficiência que afectava as suas pernas, por isso a sua amplitude de movimento era limitada, o que a fazia lenta. Hashimoto teve um papel importante a cobrir-a para compensar isso.Até onde pude dizer, ele era a única pessoa da classe A aqui. além disso, não parecia que ele estivesse a tentar falar com alguém em particular. Ele estava provavelmente a procurar por aí para ver quem entreu em contacto com quem no encontro-e-grato. Como organizador deste evento, cerca de metade das pessoas da classe B estavam presentes, tanto rapazes como raparigas, Ichinose incluindo. Kanzaki estava lá também, pelo lado de Ichinose, a apoiar-a. No entanto, não tive a impressione de que os alunos que estavam presentes da classe B eram aqueles que eram ou muito bons alunos ou aqueles que estavam preocupados com a sua proeza académica. Parecia que a classe B tinha simplesmente escolhido enviar os membros mais sociáveis da sua classe.Por outro lado, depois de olhar brevemente, não vi ninguém da classe C à volta. Era quase como se consideraram que este encontro era totalmente opcional, desde o início. Através deste único evento, conseguimos ver de alguma forma os motivos de cada uma das aulas de segundo ano. No entanto, não eram os alunos do segundo ano que eram importantes para Horikita hoje. Estava focada nos primeiros anos, as pessoas que quase não conhecíamos. Eu estava certo que os alunos do primeiro ano, que só começaram aqui, não sabiam o que ainda estava a acontecer. Muitos deles estavam provavelmente a lutar para envolverem a cabeça à volta da situação com alunos do segundo ano a pedirem, subitamente, para se juntarem a eles. Eles viram-se para trás de todos os outros no evento, agarrando-se aos seus colegas de turma, o que é o que é dizer, os alunos com os quaisAo ver isso, Ichinose tentou o melhor que conseguiu para expandir o seu círculo fazendo auto-introdução e conversa casual, sem realmente mencionar o exame especial. Claro, não era como se as pessoas estivessem prestes a abrir-se imediatamente ou qualquer coisa. Sabendo isto, ela não acelerou a fazer coisas, mas ao invés disso, aproximou-se das pessoas lentamente, olhando para elas com um sorriso gentil na sua cara. Depois, os seus corações endurecidos, que pareciam estar congelados como gelo, começaram a derreter-se. Depois de apenas alguns minutos de observação neste encontro-e-grato, eu tive uma ideia geral de como as coisas iriam ir de aqui. \"\" Ao invés de dar prioridade ao exame especial, ela está a construir relações baseadas em confiança mutua, primeiro. Isso é certamente uma forma muito Ichinose-sanNão se sabia quanto a classe B iria fazer uso desta estratégia, mas era especialmente importante, no entanto. O que a Ichinose estava a fazer só podia beneficiar tanto os estudantes do primeiro como do segundo ano. Horikita chamou a Ichinose \"\" agradável \"\" por pôr este plano em ação. Olhando para o perfil lateral da Horikita, eu poderia adivinhar a estratégia que ela deve ter pensado em si mesma. \"Estas a pensar numa estratégia semelhante você mesmo?\" Perguntei. \"... Sim. Uma estratégia baseada no uso de Pontos Privos é demasiado para a classe D lidar. Por isso pensei que seria importante para nós construirmos relações baseadas na confiança com os primeiros anos. Contudo, nós não estamos em ligação com o Ichinose-san nisso. Ou melhor, eu deveria dizer, esse tipo de estratégia é a sua especialidade,\" disse Horikita.Se quisessem que alguém vos aceite como o vosso parceiro, precisavam de lhes oferecer alguma coisa. Aquela coisa poderia ser uma série de coisas diferentes, como pontos, confiança, amizade, ou uma dívida de gratidão. \"Ichinose Honami-san da classe 2-B já é bastante conhecida entre muitas das primeiras anos. Conhecem o seu nome e a sua cara. Estou certa que estudantes ansiosos irão afastar-se para ela, e ela irá corresponder às suas expectativas, \"\" acrescentou Horikita. \"Sim, acho que sim, \"\" disse eu. Eles não iriam incomodar-se a chegar a nós, classe 2-D, pessoas que eles não sabiam de todo. \"Mas mesmo se não conseguirmos duplicar os seus métodos admiráveis, há coisas que podemos fazer,\" disse Horikita.Aparentemente, Horikita tinha tido algum tipo de ideia a partir deste evento. A essência dessa ideia teve provavelmente algo a ver com como ela estava constantemente a olhar para os primeiros anos com a aplicação OAA aberta. Ela não deu nenhum sinal de querer sair ainda, continuando a observar os primeiros anos. Eu não era o único a estar ao seu lado, a observar, também. Uma grande figura movida por nós. \"\" Mas, sabem, todos eles parecem umas ratas. Cada último de eles, \"\" atormentou Sudou, a estar ao lado de Horikita, a partilhar o que ele pensava sobre os primeiros anos.Sudou tinha originalmente planeado ir directo para as suas atividades do clube logo depois da aula, hoje. Mas porque a pedido de Ichinose de organizar este evento de encontro e saudade foi aceite, e foi assim de repente decidido que o ginásio estaria em uso até às 5h00, ele ofereceu-se para acompanhar Horikita aqui. Horikita tinha-o recusado, dizendo-lhe que não era necessário que ele viesse, mas acho que deve ter estado bem no final, já que ele estava a ir para o ginásio, de qualquer forma. \"Não olhem para eles por nenhuma razão. Não há nada a ganhar a assustá-los,\" disse Horikita.\"\" Eu não estou mesmo a brilhar \"\" ou qualquer coisa. Esta é apenas a forma como o meu rosto parece. De qualquer forma, está mesmo bem para nós ficarmos deitarmo-nos atrás e chillarmos assim? Não vão os miúdos inteligentes ser apanhados pela Ichinose? Qual é o dano em apenas falar com eles? \"\" disse Sudou impazientemente, sugerindo a Horikita que eles deveriam ir falar com os alunos mais cedo do que mais tarde. Mesmo que um aluno do nosso nível que não estava na classe B fosse fazer um movimento num dos primeiros anos, a Ichinose não ficaria a ficar chateada com isso. Se alguma coisa, eu tinha a certeza que ela iria acolher isso felizmente. \"O que é que vais fazer?\" perguntei a Horikita, \"\" pois eu própria estava a pensar nisso. \"Acha que acham queNeste momento, Ichinose parecia estar a enfatizar a providenciar alívio para os primeiros anos em tentar assegurar que a sua própria turma iria ganhar. A partir do aspeto das coisas, nem um único dos estudantes da turma B tinha saído ainda, e eles pareciam estar a tentar conhecer os primeiros anos melhor, para aprofundar as suas amizades. Aposto que os primeiros anos também tinham reparado no seu entusiasmo.Em vez de participar no encontro, estávamos a retirar-nos. O que significava que Horikita não tinha tido a intenção de tentar trazer os primeiros anos de vida para o nosso lado durante todo o tempo neste evento. “Estão certos que isso está bem, Suzune?” perguntou Sudou. “Mais da metade dos estudantes que foram convidados não vieram para este encontro. Estes são os estudantes com os quais vou negociar, ” disse Horikita.Por outras palavras, ia fazer-se focar nos estudantes do primeiro ano que não se haviam incomodado a ouvir a oferta de Ichinose. No mesmo tempo, no entanto, o facto de estes estudantes ignorarem a oferta de Ichinose provou que seria difícil conquistá-los. Podiam pensar que poderiam encontrar um parceiro por si mesmos, com base nas suas próprias capacidades, sem aceitar uma mão de ajuda. Ou talvez não tivessem coragem de sair para este encontro e sauda. Podiam até já ter uma estratégia em mente. O que quer que seja o caso, podíamos presumir que muitos deles seriam provavelmente um pouco excentricos, e difíceis de lidar.\"\" Duas razões. Até onde consigo dizer, \"\" a partir do que vi apenas alguns momentos antes, \"\" um percentagem inesperado de estudantes que vieram ao encontro \"\" eram pessoas preocupadas com a sua proeza académica. O que estamos a procurar neste momento, \"\" mais urgentemente, posso acrescentar, \"\" são estudantes que têm pelo menos um B menos ou melhor em capacidade académica. Quer dizer, \"\" os estudantes que têm confiança suficiente para fazerem batalha sem virem ao encontro \"\", disse Horikita. Eu vejo. Se tal fosse o caso, suponho que tivessemos sentido deixar o encontro \"\". \"\" A nossa primeira prioridade não deveria ser o arranjar dois estudantes de uma classe A uns com os outros. \"\" Trata-se de convencer os estudantes com capacidade académica suficiente para cobrir os estudantes mais fracos da nossa turma para virem ao nosso lado, \"\" para garantir que absolutamenteNo entanto, mesmo que a classe 2-B tivesse pouvido muito dos primeiros anos, naturalmente haveria muito que ficar. Além disso, a Ichinose ia provavelmente dar prioridade ao poupar os estudantes menos capazes em vez de ajudar os mais capazes. Era possível que tivéssemos tido alguns dos estudantes restantes da \"\" meet-and-greet \"\" — alguns que eram melhores estudantes, até certo ponto. Asumi que a sua segunda razão tinha alguma coisa a ver com isso. \"\" Além disso, havia um pouco de preconceito nos estudantes que frequentavam a \"\" meet-and-greet \"\", independentemente da capacidade académica, \"\" disse Horikita. \"\" preconceitos? \"\" O facto de que nenhum dos estudantes da classe 1-D frequentava de todo, \"\" disse Horikita. Nenhum deles tinha frequentado? Eu vejo. Isso foi certamente um preconceito bastante interessante. \"\" Parece que também percebes, \"\"Entendem o quê? O que é que o facto de não haver nenhum dos miúdos da turma 1 D aparecer significa?\" perguntou Sudou, a cortar a cabeça. Colocou a cabeça para o lado, sem perceber o que era a importância da sua ausência. \"\" Há quarenta pessoas numa turma. Entre essas quarenta estão estudantes com notas fracas e estudantes que não são particularmente bons em comunicação. E, no entanto, não participou uma única pessoa da turma 1 D. \"\" O facto de ninguém ter asistido \"\" é obviamente um reflexo da vontade da turma \"\", disse Horikita. Era claro que alguém estava a controlar a turma inteira, e lhes tinha instruído a não participar na \"\" зустріч e sauda \"\". Podíamos certamente dizer que isso era invulgar, considerando que ainda não tinham passado alguns dias desde que o semestre começou. \"\" Então, você está a dizer que já há um\"\" Se existe uma pessoa com quem podemos negociar \"\" que fala para a classe inteira, \"\" então já não é necessário tentar negociar com as pessoas individualmente, \"\" disse Horikita. Por outras palavras, a sua estratégia era para os alunos em cada uma das nossas turmas, 1 D e 2 D, para nos coberem uns aos outros. \"Ok, isso está bem e bom. Mas se o fizermos, não vamos ter hipótese de ganhar isto, pois não somos?\" perguntou Sudou. Não foi uma má ideia, \"\" para impedir que alguém seja expulsado. \"\" Mas seria provavelmente impossível para nós batermos com as outras turmas em notas gerais \"\". \"Está bem. Nesse sentido, não estou a planear fazer guerra com as outras turmas desta vez, \"\" disse Horikita. \"\" Não estou exactamente na posição de dizer muito de alguma coisa sobre isso, \" masEmbora a sua abordagem fosse certamente diferente, a ideia geral por trás da sua estratégia era semelhante à de Ichinose, do seu som. A ideia era que vocês iriam desistir da vossa oportunidade numa oportunidade valiosa de obter Pontos de Classe, um exame especial. O Hashimoto da Classe A já estava a sair do ginásio, talvez porque estava a enlouquecer à volta do encontro de Ichinose. Horikita seguiu Hashimoto, a avançar para a saída do ginásio. Sudou e eu segui-a. Mas mesmo antes de eu sair, olhei brevemente para a Ichinose. Ichinose, sem notar a minha presença, estava a falar com uma estudante do primeiro ano com um sorriso na sua cara. Eu tinha a certeza de que ela não iria duvidar em extender uma mão de ajuda, independentemente da nota de capacidade académica daquele aluno. Mesmo que fosse DEla estava a lutar para impedir que alguém da sua classe fosse expulso, abandonando a ideia de alcançar a vitória neste teste especial. Era sobre a mesma coisa que Horikita estava a tentar fazer, embora de uma forma diferente. Ou era? A essência das suas estratégias era mesmo a mesma? \"Yo.\" Assim que nós saímos do ginásio, Hashimoto chamou-nos, como se tivesse estado à espera de nós. \"Man, ela é a mesma como sempre, não é ela? Ichinose, quero dizer,\" disse ele. \" Parece que está a dar prioridade à salvação dos seus colegas de turma e dos primeiros anos, sim,\" disse Horikita. \"Sim, de certeza. Definitivamente não parece que a Ichinose seja uma ameaça no momento. Não recebe o que é um desvantagem que ela vai ter para pegar num monte de idiotas? \"Man, é como se ela estivesse aNão havia hipótese de ele ter percebido que Horikita estava a ir para quase a mesma coisa, provavelmente porque ele nem conseguia imaginar o pensamento de Horikita a desistir de tentar vencer. \"\" Talvez seja porque ela já sabia que, nos primeiros anos, foi capaz de organizar um encontro como este \"\", disse Horikita. \"Ah, sim, eu percebi. Isso é verdade,\" disse Hashimoto. \"\" Vocês da classe A... Sakayanagi-san compreenderam sem sequer precisar de ver o encontro-e-grato. A razão pela qual ela não participou foi porque ela já anticipou o tipo de estudantes que iriam aparecer aqui, \"\" disse Horikita. \"Bem, talvez,\" disse Hashimoto. Mesmo assim, ela tinha provavelmente enviado Hashimoto sozinho como batedor. \" Então, como é que planeias colocar os alunos de honra ao teu lado?\" perguntou Horikita. \"Todo isso dependeCom essa resposta, Hashimoto começou a sair, talvez porque estava satisfeito com o breve intercambio que acabámos de ter. \"\" Não confiem numa palavra que o \"\" jerkoff Hashimoto \"\" diz, Suzune. \"\" Não precisam de me dizer isso. Esperem, estão familiarizados com o Hashimoto-kun?\" perguntou Horikita. \"Não, de todo, \"\" disse Sudou orgulhosamente, arrogantemente. \"... Eu vejo. Bem, a classe A tem uma grande vantagem simplesmente por ser a classe A. Suponho que é só natural que vão ter algumas pessoas a afastar-se para elas, até certo ponto, \"\" disse Horikita.Nós íamos ver como eram as coisas para a classe 1-D. Aparentemente, ela estava aproveitando a oportunidade que nos era apresentada enquanto os outros estavam focados no encontro-e-graças.4.1 Nós fizemos o nosso caminho para o chão onde os estudantes do primeiro ano estavam – o chão a que tínhamos ido regularmente até mesmo no mês passado. Não pareceu haver muitos estudantes à volta, considerando que bastantes tinham ido para o ginásio. Olhámos à volta e vimos vários estudantes, desde a classe A até à classe C. Mesmo que não lhes chamássemos, quando eles nos aperceberam e nos reconheceram como membros da classe superior, eles olharam para longe, como se fosse incómodo ou desconfortável.Suponho que não havia hipótese de sermos bem-vindos com braços abertos assim tão facilmente, depois de de repente colocarmos o pé no chão dos primeiros anos. Havia alguns estudantes que não nos pareciam importar, mas a maioria deles não gostava exatamente da incómoda aparência de nos ter lá. Isto seria provavelmente o caso amanhã, e todos os dias posteriores também. Estava certo de que alguns estudantes, a tentar encontrar um parceiro o mais rápido possível, iriam aproximar-se dos primeiros anos em todas as alturas do dia, tanto as manhãs como as tardes. Mas isso foi uma jogada perigosa que poderia acabar por ser de reboque. Mesmo assim, havia estudantes a conversar e a rir felizmente nas salas de aula do primeiro ano em que olhámos. Talvez sentissem que não havia necessidade de entrar em pânico sobre este exame especial. Ou talvez ainda não\"Bem, parece que muitos dos estudantes que estiveram por trás não estão muito preocupados, afinal de contas,\" disse Horikita. \"Bem, isso é bom. E aqui estou mesmo de loucos, \"\" enfureceu Sudou. Os estudantes do primeiro ano só ficariam suspensos os seus pagamentos de Ponto Privo por três meses se conseguirem cincocentos pontos ou menos no exame. Isso ainda foi certamente uma enorme perda, claro, mas desde que o depósito inicial nas suas contas deveria ter sido feito logo após a cerimonia de entrada, eles provavelmente não sentiram nenhum sentido de perigo iminente.Do mesmo que estávamos a terminar a nossa inspecção da Classe 1-C, Horikita ouviu uma voz familiar chamar-lhe. \"Ku ku. Chegámos aqui muito tarde, Suzune.\" O dono desta voz não era mais do que Ryuuen Kakeru, da Classe\"Está aqui a scouting out first-year students too, Ryuuen-kun? I don 't remember seeing you at the meet-and-greet,\" disse Horikita. \"\" It was just a buncha moronic half-wits who got together at the gym, right? I didn' t even need to go see it to know that, \"\" disse Ryuuen. Ele tinha vindo aqui à procura de estudantes que não foram ao meet-and-greet, tal como Horikita estava a planear fazer. A partir da forma como estava a falar, era claro que ele estava depois dos estudantes de primeiro ano de topo. Tinha sido apenas uma pequena diferença de 20 ou 30 minutos no nosso tempo, mas... Com aquele tempo, era possível que ele já tinha mesmo scouted com sucesso um número de estudantes. Nós teríamos a possibilidade de verificar se cada estudante se havia estabelecedo com um parceiro àsNão é que as outras duas pessoas comigo hoje iriam acreditar nele tão facilmente, embora. Isto é, até que a aplicação se arrefecisse realmente, e mostrou que parcerias foram concluídas ou não para a Classe 2 C. \"\" Parece que não me acreditas, \"\" disse Ryuuen. \"\" Bem, estou a pegar em tudo o que diz com um grão de sal, pelo menos, \"\" respondeu Horikita. \"\" Oh, ok. Parece que tem ficado bem atento a mim, huh? \"\" \"Oh? Não me consigo lembrar de nunca estar mesmo atento a si antes, embora. Hm?\" \"Kukuku! Bem, sim, suponho que tem um ponto lá, \"\" disse Ryuuen. Sudou olhou para Ryuuen, talvez não gostasse da forma engraçada que ele faleu com Horikita. \"\" Uma pessoa normal teria enEle pareceu estar pronto para sair do garfo, mas Horikita o manteve em linha com uma suave onda da sua mão. \"Oh, você precisa de cérebros para ser um guarda-corpo? Fale sobre o pote a chamar o chalão negro,hm?\" disse Horikita. Ela não afastava os olhos do Ryuuen enquanto a entregava esse regresso, ainda a segurar a sua mão para manter o Sudou de volta. \"Você está a planear as assustações dos primeiros anos? Tem medo que tomar esse tipo de atitude com eles vá fazer retroceder em si,\" disse Horikita. Eles certamente ficariam comprimidos se viram o Ryuuen a andar como se ele fosse o péro do caminho. \"Fiquei que se os ameaçasse um pouco, eles concordariam imediatamente em cooperar,\" disse Ryuuen.Horikita tinha estado a ir tit-for\"...Estas a brincar, não é? Acha que isso é realmente uma forma aceitável de fazer as coisas?\" perguntou Horikita. \"Acceptável ou não, quem se preocupa com isso. Qual é o problema se alguém se sentir um pouco ameaçado? Disseram-nos que não podíamos forçar alguém a obter uma nota inferior ou alguma coisa, mas não havia nada sobre não usar ameaças para encontrar um parceiro nas regras,\" disse Ryuuen. \" Isto porque deve ir sem dizer que não está bem, sem precisar de ser descrito nas regras. Se há um problema, você vai ficar em sarilhos,\" disse Horikita. \"E então mostra-me onde o problema está. Eu não vou fazer alguma coisa suficientemente estúpida para que seja trazida de volta para mim, de qualquer forma,\" disse Ryuuen.Ele era tão arrojado e cauteloso como sempre. Não só estava a dizer que era extremamente provável que iria fazer bem com as suas ameaças, mas também afirmava, de forma bastante definitiva, que a verdade da questão nunca iria sair. Quer o que ele estava a dizer fosse verdade ou mentira, Horikita também deve ter percebido, uma vez mais, que o Ryuuen iria sempre optar por governar com a mão de ferro de um ditador militar. \"Bem, nesse caso, faça o que quiser. Mas se houver alguma prova que se apresentasse, eu levantarei a questão, sem perguntas, \"\" disse Horikita.\"Encontráste alguma coisa quando eras snoopin 'a volta do meet-and-greet, hm? E depois aceleráste-te aqui para ver quem ficou?\" disse Ryuuen. \"Aquela mesma que então, talvez?\" \"Ku ku. Sim, talvez.\" Ryuuen continuou a falar com Horikita depois de dizer que, como se tudo o que queria fosse manter as coisas interessantes. \" Nesse caso, eu dir-vos-ei alguma coisa boa, já que estamos na mesma amplitude de onda. O batalho deste ano de carne fresca são todos muito calmos, mesmo que apenas comecem aqui. O que significa que há uma boa hipótese de alguém da escola dizer a estes novos miúdos como as coisas funcionam, até certo ponto,\" disse Ryuuen.Se isso era verdade, foi um pouco inesperado de informação. Em abril, não faziamos ideia do que estava a acontecer, e toda a gente baratava-se tanto quanto que quisesse como resultado. Claro, os estudantes da classe A e da classe B eram mais compostas, mas isso podia provavelmente ser atribuído à diferença significativa entre os nossos contextos. Além disso, o que Ryuuen estava a falar não era apenas uma classe específica. Ele estava a referir-se ao nível completo da turma. Talvez esta fosse uma medida que tinha sido tomada porque eles tinham de relacionar-se com estudantes do segundo ano mesmo no início da escola? Ou a escola tinha outras intenções, talvez? \"Não é possível que o batalho deste ano de novos estudantes estejam apenas muito rápidos, e estávamos apenas excecionalmente lentos?\" respondeu Horikita. \" Há sinais de que alguns deles já estão a juntar-se, como\"\" Mesmo que tivessem começado a tentar juntar-se como uma turma quando o teste especial foi anunciado, \"\" eles não teriam sucesso já. Ryuuen estava a dizer que não iriam juntar-se assim, \"\" agora, \"\" a não ser que tivessem começado o processo numa fase inicial. Pouco depois de terem entrado na escola. \"\"... Que tipo de truque cobarde estão a tentar tirar ao dizer-me isto?\" perguntou Horikita. \"\" Nada, nada de truque. Não se pode simplesmente pulverizar os seus oponentes neste teste especial. Nada assim. Mas se vamos ganhar em geral, provavelmente vamos ter que tirar várias cordas, \"\" disse Ryuuen.Não ia ser fácil fazer expulsos estudantes das outras turmas neste teste especial. O sentido de anonimato nele, de imaginar quem ia ser associado com quem, era bastante significativo. Iria ser muito difícil determinar exatamente quem eram as pessoas associadas na aplicação, a não ser que as pessoas estivessem a andar à volta a fazerem parcerias conhecidos publicamente ou que fossem muito bons a recolher informação. Mesmo que fossem capazes de fazer com colegas que não fizeram tão bem academicamente a parceria com estudantes de turmas rivales, ou mesmo que fossem designar alguém especificamente para esse propósito, seria quase impossível fazer com que o aluno cortasse cantos intencionalmente no teste.Se tivéssemos uma pontuação baixa — uma por não corresponder ao nível de capacidade académica que tínhamos de ter — seria claramente intencional, e então teríamos de ser expulsado independentemente do nível de ensino em que estávamos. No fim, a diferença entre a vitória e a derrota caiu em duas coisas: as capacidades dos estudantes na nossa classe, e as capacidades dos estudantes do primeiro ano. Em termos de estratégia, o que podíamos fazer era ganhar tantos anos de primeiro ano com conhecimentos académicos para a nossa classe quanto possível.Não ia ser fácil para a Classe C chegar ao topo neste exame, considerando os seus baixos níveis de capacidade global. Não havia forma de esperar que pudessem competir com a Classe A financeiramente, e as competências académicas das duas classes estavam em níveis completamente diferentes. Não importa quantos dinheiro atiraram nos primeiros anos para tentar e caçar, os resultados não iriam ser bonitos. Nesse caso, deveriam abandonar a ideia de tentar ganhar o primeiro lugar global e fazer o objetivo em vez da competição individual, com recompensas dadas aos trinta por cento do topo. Claro, Horikita não fazia nenhuma menção disso. Porque seria um problema para nós se a Classe A e a Classe C não tentassem lutar umas com as outras para pontos globais. Ao invés de deixar a Classe A facilmente apanhar o topo, eu estava a esperar que a A e a C a lutarem numa grande escala\"\" Tenta fazer o que puder para andar em frente, \"\" chidou Ryuuen. \"\" Suponho que eu pudesse dizer o mesmo a ti. \"\" As tuas preocupações são completamente innecesárias, \"\" disse Horikita. \"\" Ku ku. Bem, meu mal. \"\" Então Ryuuen saiu imediatamente, vaciando o andar dos alunos do primeiro ano. Ele tinha estado aqui muito pouco tempo para ter terminado o que precisava de fazer. \"\" Os primeiros anos podem resistir-nos muito mais forte que eu pensava \"\", disse Horikita. \"\" Se eles fossem conscientes do facto de estarem basicamente presos numa luta desesperada até à morte com as outras turmas desta escola, \"\" então sim, eu suponho que era só natural que eles tivessem receio em negociar com nós. \"\" Nesse caso, não deveríamos tentar negociar com eles pelo\"\" Acho que não vai ser assim tão simples \"\", disse Horikita. Aparentemente, Horikita também tinha reparado nisso enquanto estava a falar com o Ryuuen. O tempo inteiro que eles falavam, \"\" desde que o Ryuuen saiu da sala de aula, \"\" até quando ele saiu, \"\" não se via nenhum aluno a sair da sala de aula. E não ouvimos nenhum som enquanto nos aproximamos da sala de aula. Quando acabámos por chegar à porta da sala de aula e a abrir, \"\" as nossas suspeitas foram confirmadas. \"\" Dude D, o que é que está a acontecer? \"\", gritou Sudou em pânico, enquanto examinava o interior da sala de aula do fim ao fim. \"Negotar com a classe 1-D pode ser muito, muito mais difícil do que eu esperava \"\", disse Horikita. A sala de aula estava completamente\"\" Esta aula pode ser mais difícil do que eu pensava \"\", acrescentou ela. No entanto, não era como se pudéssemos simplesmente sentar-nos aqui e engolir na nossa ansiedade. Precisávamos de agir antes que as outras aulas realmente começaram a fazer os seus movimentos com toda a séridão. A competição estava a começar amanhã. A batalha de Horikita ia começar no momento em que ela contactou a classe 1-D. Quanto a mim, eu ia voltar para o meu alojamento e memorizar todos os nomes e as caras dos novos alunos na aplicação OAA. Horikita tinha a sua batalha para lutar, e eu tinha a minha. E como aconteceu, no dia em que o teste especial foi anunciado, um total de 22 parcerias foram concluídas.4.2 A SITUação teve um fim, viragem inesperada perto do fim da pausa para o almoço no dia seguinteO meu colega Miyamoto gritou: \"\" Olá, rapazes! Algumas crianças de primeiro ano estão a caminho \"\". Este exame especial dependeva dos alunos de primeiro e segundo anos a trabalharem juntos. Podiam pensar que não seria um desenvolvimento tão surpreendente, mas, aparentemente, não foi o caso. \"\" Uau, têm que ser muito corajosos para subirem ao andar do andar dos alunos de topo \"\", disse o Yousuke, enquanto eu engolhei as coisas na minha cabeça. \"\" Quer dizer, se decidissemos subir ao andar do terceiro ano, teríamos que ter muito cuidado para não fazer um barulho \"\". \"Sim, é verdade...\" Seria uma história diferente se tivéssemos muitas amizades estreitas com os nossos senpai, mas, para o grupo de novos alunos de este ano, não foi o caso. Muitas delas devem ter sentido que estavam a aventurar-se em territórioYousuke disse que ia ir ver, então eu segui-o, dirigi-me para o corredor. Horikita e Sudou seguiam-nos logo a seguir. A primeira coisa que me apanhou foi um tipo com uma estrutura particularmente grande. Havia várias razões para ele destacar, uma das quais era que parecia estar à volta da altura de Sudou. Mas, mais do que isso, foi a impressione forte que ele teve ao andar com confiança pelo centro do corredor no nosso chão. Os outros alunos do segundo ano do corredor evitaram-no, andando pelos lados do corredor. O que parecia o o oposto do que normalmente esperavam. A seguir um pequeno caminho atrás deste aluno era uma rapariga. Horikita, percebendo que eles não estavam simplesmente aqui à procura de parceiros, saíu à frente do aluno masculino para bloquear o seu caminho. Sudou ficou perto dela.Quando Horikita e Sudou vieram cara a cara com estes novos alunos, o aluno do primeiro ano estabeleceu contacto visual comigo por alguma razão, mesmo que eu estive a observar à distância. Pouco depois, ele olhou para mim e mudou o olhar para Horikita. Eu puxei os dados que tinha aprendido da OAA ontem na minha memória. Parecia que Horikita estava prestes a fazer um contacto inesperado com essa aula. \"Quem é esta rapariga?\" perguntou o rapaz. \"Por favor, esperem um momento... Achei-a,\" disse a rapariga. Depois de tocar com o telemóvel durante um curto tempo, ela mostrou-lhe o ecrã. \"Class 2D. Horikita Suzune. Capacidade académica A-, huh?\" disse o rapaz, agudo.A rapariga falava com um tom de voz bastante educado, ao contrário do rapaz, o que as fazia parecer uma combinação estranha. Depois dirigiam os olhos para o Sudou, que estava ao lado do Horikita. E assim como antes, a rapariga mostrou ao rapaz o seu ecrã de telemóvel. “Sudou Ken... Heh.” Depois de olhar para os dados do Sudou, o rapaz libertou-se de um snort de rir. “Olá, o meu nome é Nanase, da classe 1-D. Ele é da mesma classe. Isto é – ” Housen, ” disse ele, a interferir-a. Ambos deram-nos os seus apelidos. Apenas para referência, o grande rapaz o nome completo era Housen Kazuomi e a rapariga era Nanase Tsubasa. Eram ambos estudantes autênticos da classe 1-D, tal como disseram\"\" Apesar da sua chegada súbita aqui \"\" foi bastante inesperada, \"\" foi tanto uma sorte como um golpe de fortuna para Horikita. Isto foi porque não pudemos começar a negociar com a turma 1 D ao ar livre, \"\" enquanto nos olhos atentos dos outros alunos. \"\" Para um par de novos alunos, fizeste algo muito corajoso. Eu admiro a sua pluca, \"\" disse Horikita. \"\" O quê? Você admira a nossa pluca? Não se comportes tão alto e poderoso, mulher, \"\" disse Housen. \"\" Ela não está muito alta e poderoso, meu amigo. \"\" Não ficas todo bem, meu amigo, \"\" gritou Sudou. Housen tinha acertado em Horikita, o que fez com que Sudou se atrofasse em sua vez. Mesmo que eles tivessem a mesma altura, Housen tinha uma estrutura ligeiramente maior,\"Bem, o que quer que seja, isto está bem. Parece que este lugar está mesmo a rastejar com rejeitos da classe D, de qualquer forma. Funciona para mim.\" \"O que é que isso quer dizer?\" perguntou Horikita. \"Como disse, os punks da classe D são apenas um monte de rejeitos, sobras. Vocês nem podem formar pares a não ser que os escolhemos. Então pensei, Ei, vou dar-vos uma mão a incompetentes, idiotas mortas de cérebro. Vocês conseguem o que eu digo?\" disse Housen. Era quase como se ele estivesse a testar Horikita. \"O que significa que querem que nos juntem a vocês. E estão a fazer a vossa exigência com uma atitude bastante condescendente,\" respondeu ela. \"Uh, sim? Quero dizer, vocês são os que deveriam pedir-nos que nosHorikita, ainda a segurar no Sudou para o impedir de perder a sua irritação, argumentou contra ele, as suas palavras a crescer em intensidade apesar da diferença de tamanho entre ela e Housen. \"\" Parece que estás a mal perceber alguma coisa. As nossas posições são iguais. \"\" iguais? \"\" O teu amigo idiota aí \"\" oughta \"\" ser a única a tirar merda assim \"\", disse Housen. \"\" Estás na classe D, tal como nós. Não há diferença entre nós \"\", disse Horikita. \"\" Não percebes. Há muitas coisas que nos podemos fazer se nos apercebermos dela. percebes? Quer dizer, não queres problemas, certo? Então devias saber o teu lugar e começar a mendigar \"\". Aparentemente, esta pessoa Housen já tinha reparado que os primeiros anos tinham uma arma secreta que podiam usar em sua vantagem.\"E o que é que essas coisas podem fazer-nos?\" perguntou Horikita. Ela provavelmente já sabia a resposta, mas foi deliberadamente perguntada de qualquer forma, para fazer a Housen sair e dizer-o. \"Vai lá, sabes, não sabes? O que estou a dizer é que podemos obter maus resultados de testes, de propósito,\" disse Housen. Quando a Horikita ouviu dizer isso, morrou-a o labio com alguma força. \"Huh?! Já chega, pequeno idiota do primeiro ano! Tu repetis o teste, e irás fora da escola!\" gritou Sudou. \"Stop. Não seja tão rápido para perder o teu bom, Sudou-kun. É um mau hábito teu,\" disse Horikita. \"Mas...\" eu conseguia perceber porque é que Sudou quereria soltar a sua raiva depois de ouvir a Housen falar com Horikita assim. Contudo, o\"Sim, é verdade que, se fizermos mal o teste de propósito, somos expulsados. Mas a multa por não sermos \"\" capazes de encontrar um parceiro antes do fim do tempo é diferente. Isso só se aplica a vocês, certo?\" disse Housen. As regras afirmam que, se ficarmos sem tempo antes de encontrarmos um parceiro, um será atribuído aleatóriamente a vocês. Em cima disso, se ficarmos sem tempo, seria uma multa de 5% retirada da vossa pontuação geral. E os estudantes do segundo ano, que poderiam enfrentar a expulsão, iriam receber mais danos desta multa. \"I - é isso mesmo verdade?!\" gritou Sudou, incrédula. Ele tirou Horikita com uma aparência implícita, à procura de confirmação se o que a Housen disse ser verdade. A única resposta que ela lhe poderia dar foi \"\" sim \"\"Você não estaria a pôr uma presa à volta do seu próprio pescoço ao fazer isso, no entanto? \"Você realmente pretende perder imediatamente depois de começar a escola?\" perguntou Horikita. Se tivessem sido atingidos com uma pena, as suas hipóteses de obter cinco centenões e um ponto ou mais no teste seriam naturalmente em queda. \"Bem, comparados a vocês, não se pode dizer que nos feriríamos assim tão mal. Não é isso mesmo?\", disse Housen. Olhou para a rapariga que estava atrás dele, Nanase, para confirmação. \"Sim, isso é certo. Não teríamos nenhum Pontos Privados depositados na nossa conta durante três meses, mas isso ainda seria um máximo de dois centenões e quatro mil pontos. Não acho que seria um regresso fatal,\" respondeu Nanase. \"Vê agora a fotografia, Horikita-senpai?\"Housen olhou para Horikita como se fosse superior a ela, mesmo que ela fosse a sua sénaira. Sudou, vendo-o trata-la assim, deve ter perdido a paciência. Ele ficou agora em frente de Horikita, exusando intimidação, embora ainda não estivesse a atirar punções. \"Vocês querem ir?\" disse Housen, sem qualquer hesitation. \"Não fiquem demasiado cheios de vocês mesmos, punk,\" abruçou Sudou. \"Não perdem o vosso bom, Sudou-kun. Vocês percebem como as coisas funcionam nesta escola, não percebem?\" disse Horikita. Não era razoável que os novos alunos não o soubessem, mas os corredores estavam controlados muito de perto por oficiais da escola. As câmaras de vigilância estavam constantemente a monitorizar-nos, por isso se houvesse um problema, osDepois de ter sido repetidamente alertado pelo Horikita, Sudou recuou, embora pareça irritado. Era certamente um problema que ele se abrucia tão facilmente, mas eu supus que tudo o que demorou foi uma palavra de Horikita para o manter sob controlo era um alívio. Nesse momento, quando a atenção de Sudou estava focada no Horikita, Housen atirou a sua grande mão em frente contra o peito de Sudou e atirou-o. \"O quê?!\" No instante seguinte, Sudou perdeu o equilíbrio, caindo para trás, aterrando nas suas mãos. \"Ha, a única coisa grande sobre si é a sua altura, perdente. Só um pequeno toque foi tudo o que demorou?\"O que a Housen fez foi tão imprudente que até os outros alunos do segundo ano a ver a situação não conseguiam esconder o seu desconforto. Considerando o quão dramático a ação tinha sido, não seria surpreendente que fosse vista como um acto de violência. Se perceberam o quão difícil e arriscado era tentar fazer algo violento nesta escola, não o poderiam fazer. Pensámos que o grupo de novos alunos deste ano estavam mais familiarizados com como as coisas funcionavam nesta escola do que os alunos dos anos anteriores. Se a informação que tínhamos recebido do Ryuuen no outro dia era verdadeira, então eu tive de dizer que o que a Housen tinha feito era bastante imprudente. Talvez eles não compreendiam a escola tão bem como pensávamos que compreendiam? Não, não parecia que fosse o caso. Se sim, então...“ Desculpa! ”Sudou, tendo recuperado a sua serenidade e apercebedo-se do que lhe tinha acabado de ser feito, pareceu estar pronto para deixar explodir toda a sua raiva pent-up de uma só vez. Mas mesmo antes disso, outra pessoa, que tinha vindo a ver a situação de longe, saltou para dentro. \"O rapaz, o diabo é que estás a fazer?!\" Era Ishizaki Daiichi da classe 2C. Ele estava rápido a perder a sua tensão e podia ser facilmente classificado como um infractor, mas também era uma pessoa compassiva. Parecia que ele tivesse acabado de ter paciência depois de ver o Sudou, alguém do seu nível de ensino, a ser tratado com tanta crueldade. \"O homem, estes perdedores apenas mantêm o poppin 'up de lado para lado, um a seguir ao outro. Como escaravelhos,\" disse Housen com\"Housen-kun, eu pensei que vimos aqui para discutir? Se vimos aqui só para que pudesses ser violento, então eu irei sair,\" disse Nanase. \"\" Violente? Tudo o que fiz foi tocar no tipo, como se eu estivesse a picar um gato ou alguma coisa. Bem, perdão, o meu mal, Sudou, \"\" disse Housen, a dirigir-se intencionalmente a Sudou sem ser um elogio, como se ele estivesse a picar sobre ele. \"Ei, homem, você está a ir demasiado longe! Basta aquele tremo!\" gritou Ishizaki, gritando para agarrar a Housen pelo seu collar. No momento em que Housen viu o braço de Ishizaki a aproximar-se dele, no entanto, os cantos da sua boca curvaram-se ligeiramente num sorriso. \"Bem melhor pensar duas vezes\"O que é que me teriam impedido?\", murrou Ishizaki. Ele parecia visívelmente confuso pelo facto de que o Ryuuen o tinha impedido. Ibuki, um colega deles, também estava surpreendido pelo que o Ryuuen tinha feito. \"O que é que acham que estão a fazer? Ao parar-o, quero dizer?\" perguntou ela. O Ryuuen acojou as lutas de forma geral. Ele era a coisa mais longe possível de uma pessoa que odiava problemas. Não se importava se havia câmaras de segurança à sua volta ou não; quando queria deitar para baixo, fazia-o sem hesitar. O que era precisamente porque era tão surpreendente ver-o a parar uma luta a acontecer. O Ryuuen ordenou que o Ryuuen regresse e depois aproximou-se a Housen ele mesmo.\"\" Eu sei-te muito bem, sim. Lembro-me de ouvir \"\" que este sujeito do Housen era um pouco de celebridade na minha cidade natal. \"\" Eu nunca imaginei \"\" que ele parecia um idiota morrido de cabeça, \"\" respondeu Ryuuen.Housen repetidamente atirou insultos no Sudou vezes sem conta, a chamá-lo estúpido, \"\" por isso Ryuuen atirou a mesma insulta mesmo para trás no seu rosto. Algo que era honestamente muito típico do Ryuuen. Normalmente, o Ryuuen era um inimigo para todas as classes que não era o seu próprio, \"\" mas foi encorajador ver-o a levantar-se para o Housen assim. Na verdade, o Sudou conseguiu, com sucesso, encher a sua raiva graças à mudança na atmosfera. \"Y- você conhece este sujeito,\"\" Ei agora, não é isto alguma coisa? Isto tem de ser destino. Honestamente, ouvi o teu nome ser arrojado tanto que tem sido pissin'me afastar, Ryuuen, \"\" disse a Housen. \"\" Uau, então tens as células cerebrais para realmente lembrar-se do nome de alguém? \"\" respondeu Ryuuen. Aparentemente, estes dois já se sabiam um do outro há algum tempo. Parecia que Housen, da classe 1-D, veio de alguma parte perto da cidade natal de Ryuuen. Isto dizia, olhando para a relação entre Ryuuen e Ishizaki e Ibuki, parecia seguro dizer que o Ryuuen fez um regresso completo. Ele tinha saído temporariamente da sua posição, mas estava a começar a tomar o comando da sua classe uma vez mais. \"\" Peço dizer, no entanto, para o\"Sabem, eu andava um par de vezes à volta dos vossos velhos passeios porque eu estava a planear bater a merda de sempre a partir de vocês. Mas acho que a razão pela qual eu nunca vos encontrei foi porque estavam aterrorizados de mim e escondidos, não é? O que é que vocês estavam a correr e a fazer os vossos pequenos soldados fazerem tudo o trabalho? É isso?\", disse Housen. \"Ku ku. Eu diria que é mais como se afortunada a salvara o vosso bigode, Housen. Se me tivessem conhecido naquela altura, certamente não estariam a agir como um grande-bomba neste preciso momento. Acho que realmente tiveram sorte, porque podem dizer que ainda não me perderam, \"\" disse Ryuuen. \"Na verdade, acho que só fugiam com a cauda entre as vossas pernas. Se estão a tentarHousen formou a sua gigantesca mão numa punha, a olhar confiante. Se ele sabia quem era o Ryuuen no secundário, a impressão que ele tinha de Ryuuen não deveria ser assim tão diferente da impressão que tínhamos de Ryuuen. Talvez ele não tenha visto o Ryuuen como alguém que quer ser um inimigo? Sim, passa difícil. Eu não planeio lutar contra um gorila como você quando não há nada nisto para mim \"\", disse o Ryuuen. Mesmo que Housen estava a preparar uma luta, o Ryuuen desistiu da sua oferta. Claro que foi porque não havia maneira de que ele pudesse realmente lutar num sítio como este, mas... Eu estava certo de que Ishizaki e Ibuki pensavam que o Ryuuen aceitaria a oferta, mesmo que isso significasse que eles tivessem que levar a luta noutro sítio.\"Quem pode dizer?\" O Ryuuen parecia não ter a intenção de dar uma resposta direta a essa pergunta. Então ele deu uma orden aos seus subordinados, um sorriso na sua cara. \"Vamos lá.\" \"Estão mesmo bem com a deixar um primeiro ano desrespetar-vos assim?\" perguntou Ibuki. Ela estava consciente do facto de que era na natureza do Ryuuen de deitar-se contra alguém, independentemente de quem fosse. Foi por isso que não conseguia ajudar mas lhe perguntou essa pergunta. \"Heh. Nós podemos resolver as coisas sempre que for. Qual é a corrida?\" respondeu o Ryuuen, silenciosamente e calmamente. Embora as coisas tivessem acabado lá mesmo, o Housen começou a andar para a frente, fechando a distância entre ele e o Ryuuen. \"É essa rapariga também um dos seus pequenos soldados?\" perguntou o House\"\" Então até apanha-te a usar raparigas como soldados, o quê, Ryuuen?\" perguntou a Housen. \"\" Podia dizer-lhe o mesmo, meu amigo. \"\" És a pessoa que trouxe aquela coisa gira ali, certo?\" disse o Ryuuen. Tal como o Ryuuen foi acompanhado pela Ibuki, a Housen tinha a Nanase a estar ao seu lado. \"\" Ela não é minha. Bem, o que quer que seja, não me importava menos disso. Vamos divertir-nos um pouco, Ryuuen, \"\" disse a Housen. \"\" Já vos disse. Passo difícil. \"\" Não importa quantas vezes a Housen tentou provocar o Ryuuen a lutar, o Ryuuen não iria colidir. Como se fosse a sinalizar o seu desinteresse, o Ryuuen virou-se para trás do Housen,No mesmo tempo em que tentou abruçá-lo, ele acelerou rapidamente a força por trás do movimento, agarrando a Ibuki pelo pescoço e levantá-la para o ar. “Ngh?!” Ibuki tentou rapidamente libertar-se do seu aperto, como se um sinal de dor estivesse a ser transmitido do cérebro para o resto do corpo naquele momento. No entanto, Housen apenas brilhou um sorriso audaz, não dando um centímetro, como se os seus braços fossem feitos de aço. Ryuuen virou-se para trás e viu a Ibuki a ser cortada por Housen. Tentou libertar-se do seu aperto, usando de forma discreta os braços e as pernas, mas a Housen ainda não se alterou. “Hah. Tenta apenas escapar daqui. Ou todos os que estão a ver podem saltar para dentro\"\" Segundo o olhar do rosto de Housen, \"\" não era que ele não tivesse medo, \"\" mas sim que ele possuía uma certa confiança absoluta. No entanto, eu estava certo que não era o tipo de situação em que eu própria podia entrar no anel. Se fizesse uma cena aqui e agora, a escola ficaria naturalmente a ouvir o vento e, inevitavelmente, apareceria para fazer um fim à situação. \"\" O único que não estava preso por estas preocupações, \"\" Ryuuen \"\", \"\" foi o que fez um movimento, \"\" embora ele parecia bastante exasperado com isso. \"\" Provavelmente, ele estava a mover-se para salvar Ibuki \"\" em vez de dar um choque a Housen, ele mudou-se para a frente, a escorregar no espaço entre Ibuki e Housen, perto do seu peito. No entanto, Housen aindaIshizaki, a quem tinham pedido que se levantasse antes, saltou agora para a luta. Começava a explodir uma agitação como nunca poderiam imaginar a acontecer nos corredores aqui na escola. \"\" Sim, sim! Estou contento de ter vindo até esta escola \"\", disse Housen. Uma verdadeira luta sem barreiras pode começar agora mesmo em qualquer segundo. No meio de tudo isto, Nanase, que tinha estado a ver a situação desde o início, abriu a boca para falar. \"Por favor, parem, Housen-kun.\" Apesar do problema de ainda ter Ibuki na sua mão, Housen pareceu estar pronto para começar a brincar com Ryuuen e Ishizaki enquanto eles apanharam-no. Mas deixou de se movimentar depois de a sua colega Nanase lhe ter chamado. \"O que é que lhe disse?\" perguntou ele.\"\" Os homens da classe superior têm ficado preocupados com o facto de haver câmaras de vigilância aqui por algum tempo. \"\" Concluindo a partir da situação, \"\" eu determinei que não há nada a ganhar \"\" por ser violento \"\", disse Nanase. \"\" Sim, eu sei. \"\" Eu já sei, \"\" eu estive apenas a brincar com eles \"\", disse Housen, \"\" antes de acrescentar \"\" que sabia ao longo do tempo \"\" que nós, os dois anos, estávamos presos por causa das câmaras de vigilância. Se isso fosse o caso, \"\" tudo o que Housen tinha feito \"\" depois de aparecer aqui \"\" era realmente intrigante. Ele ignorou o aviso de Nanase, \"\" parece que ele estava prestes a voltar a lutar, \"\" por isso ela falou uma vez mais, \"\" em um tom mais forte doDepois de a ouvir a Housen dizer que, qualquer ideia abstracta que fosse representar, ele parou de se mover uma vez mais. Depois, com uma expressão de aborrecimento total na cara, deixou de ir a Ibuki e colocou-a no chão, onde tossou e pirateou. “Ei, não é mau, Nanase. Mas sabem só que, se não corresponderem às minhas expectativas, eu não vos mostrarei miseridão. Mesmo se forem raparigas. Conseguiram?” disse a Housen. “Quando aquele tempo chegar, eu vou pegar em tudo o que vem ao meu caminho, ” disse a Nanase. Apesar da Housen ter acabado de a ameaçar-a, a Nanase não soava aborrecida. Ela parecia tão calma que parecia que não importava um pouco para ela que estivesse agora na planta dos anos dois.Mesmo assim, este homem do Housen não era certamente um pushover. Não havia escassez de pessoas no meu nível de ensino que pudessem gabar-se da sua proeza de luta. Entre os tipos, que incluíam Ryuuen, Sudou, e Albert. Mesmo que o Housen fosse um primeiro ano, apenas este breve vislumbre dele na ação disse-me que era bastante capaz de si mesmo. Ele provavelmente não seria o tipo de oponente que eu poderia subduzir tudo isso facilmente, se eu tivesse de enfrentar-me a ele. E porque eu só tinha tido um vislumbre dele na ação, eu não podia prever como as coisas iriam ir se ele realmente fosse tudo embora. O Ryuuen tinha provavelmente tentado parar o Ishizaki a caír casualmente contra o Housen porque ele determinou que envolver-se numa simples luta de pernas os colocaria em desvantagem. Isto\"\" Isso é uma escolha sensata, \"\" respondeu Nanase. Housen, aparentemente satisfeito com tudo o resto exceto com a falta de luta, disparou um último olhar para Ryuuen. \"\" Se se baixarem sobre os seus joelhos para mim, não me importa \"\" pairin \"\" com você. Whaddya dizer, Ryuuen-paisen? \"\" \"\" Desculpa, meu amigo, mas eu só trabalho com seres humanos. Não consigo dizer que tenho nenhum plano de equipar \"\" com um gorilla selvagem. \"\" Oh, bem, isso é muito mau, \"\" disse Housen. No entanto, esta experiência inteira ainda não estava terminada. A parte de Housen e Nanase, havia outro presente do primeiro ano que tinha observado a situação inteira. Talvez Housen estivesse chateado com este outro aluno, porque ele virou a sua atenção para\"\" Sabes o provérbio \"\" um homem amplo se afasta do perigo \"\"? respondeu o aluno, afastando o brilho de Housen com uma resposta eloquente. \"\" Fazer conversas amigas é bom, \"\" mas não seria benéfico para ti fazer um ruquete aqui, Housen-kun. \"\" Mas, de qualquer forma, acho que devias retirar-te para o momento. Estou errado? \"\" Ao mesmo tempo, o rapaz deu a Housen o que poderia ser interpretado como um conselho amigável, um adulto mostrou também. \"O que estás a fazer, Housen?\" perguntou ele. Este homem solitário, vestido de fato, parecia ter aparecido do nada, como se tivesse parado toda esta situação tumultuosa. Muitos dos dois anos que estiveram parados e a ver a situação acontecer fugiram, voltando\"\" Housen, eu entendo que estás incómodo. Mas também estou bem certo que as regras da escola foram tão profundamente perfuradas na tua cabeça até agora que se sente pronta para explodir, \"\" disse o adulto. \"\" Sim, sim, eu sei, \"\" disse Housen. \"\" Se percebes, então acelere e dispersa. Não há luta nos corredores. \"\" \"\" Isto foi quase nem uma verdadeira luta, \"\" disse Housen. \"\" Com um sorriso desprezoso, \"\" colocou as mãos nos bolsos, \"\" e depois virou-se, \"\" fazendo uma decisão inesperadamente fácil de se retirar. \"\" Então, ordenou a Nanase que se retirara também. \"\" Bem, vê-te mais tarde, Horikita. \"\" Housen despediu intencionalmente o nome de Horikita antes de ir embora... Bem, não.Com essa desculpa, a situação parecia ter sido mais ou menos controlada com sucesso. Mas, quando a Nanase levantou a cabeça para trás, olhou para mim mesmo nos olhos certos enquanto estava a sair. Era o mesmo olhar que me tinha dado quando chegou a este andar. Um olhar de perspetiva, quase como se quisesse saber alguma coisa. No entanto, assim que notei que ela estava a olhar para mim, ela evitou imediatamente os olhos, e persegueu-se pela Housen. \"Eu tenho que me desculpar a todos vocês. Estou terrivelmente penada. Os meus alunos vos causaram um pouco de problemas, \"\" a professora olhou para Horikita enquanto ela ficou a ver tudo o que aconteceu. \"Não, está tudo bem...\" ela respondeu. \"Sendo que estamos aqui, por favor, permitam-me apresentar-me brevemente. Eu sou Shiba Katsunori e eu vouDepois de nos dar esse breve auto-introdução, Shiba-sensei saiu, a seguir em Housen. Depois, quase como se estivessem a passar por turnos, o rapaz de cabeça igualada de antes veio e clinou a cabeça para nós. \"\" Parece que o meu colega Housen-kun causou um grande problema para vocês, os nossos seniores. Em nome dos estudantes do primeiro ano, \"\" gostava de oferecer as minhas humildes desculpas, \"\" disse o rapaz. Ao contrário de Housen, ele parecia ser um aluno bem falado. \"\" Nós, os estudantes do primeiro ano, ainda não compreendemos estes exames especiais muito bem. \"\" Peço desculpas por os inconvenientes que isto pode causar-vos, \"\" mas nós apreciaríamos humildemente qualquer ajuda. \"\" Obrigado, \"\" disse o aluno.Depois de nos ter acabado de nos fazer os desculpas e as boas-vindas, o aluno, que aparentemente se chamava Yagami, pareceu estar prestes a deixar-se. Mas depois pareceu reparar em algo — um grupo de quatro raparigas da classe D que acabaram de voltar do almoço. Matsushita, Kushida, Satou, e Mii-chan. Yagami olhou para um membro do grupo, Kushida, com surpresa na cara. \"\" Parece que tem havido uma grande agitação. O que aconteceu, Horikita-san? \"\" Embora a Kushida estivesse claramente consciente da presença de Yagami, por sua vez, perguntou a Horikita sobre o que estava a acontecer, pareceu-lhe ser bastante curiosa. \"\" Nada com que tenhamos que nos preocupar, \"\" disse Horikita. \"Oh, realmente?\" Depois de Horikita lhes dizer que não tinha nada, a\"Hm?\" respondeu Kushida, virando-se para olhar para quem a estava a dirigir. Se ele soubesse o nome de Kushida, poderia ser um conhecido dela? Ou então pensei, mas \"\" Hum, você é? \"\" disse Kushida. Ela deu-lhe um olhar perplexo. Não havia nenhum sinal de que ela estivesse familiarizada com ele. \"\" É eu. Não me conhecem? Bem, suponho que isso é só natural que não o fariam. É Yagami Takuya, \"\" respondeu.Kushida acenou. “Sim. Mas na verdade, nunca falamos antes. De qualquer forma, o seu nome é Yagami Takuya-kun. Ele sempre parecia incrivelmente inteligente. mas como estávamos em diferentes graças, nunca dissemos muito mais do que \"\" Olá \"\" uns aos outros. \"Então, conhecem-no também?\" perguntei, sussurrando no ouvido de Horikita para obter confirmação. \"Não, eu não o conheço de todo,\" respondeu ela imediatamente. \"Bem, você não parece muito bom a lembrar-se das caras dos seus colegas, embora.\" \"Não vou negar isso. Não tive tempo para prestar atenção às pessoas com as quais não estava interessado,\" disse Horikita. Aparentemente, Horikita não reconhecia... não, era mais como se ele não se registasse na sua mente de todo. Suponho queBem, mesmo que a Kushida não se lembresse deste rapaz, provavelmente nunca conseguia esquecê-la. Foi apenas para mostrar quão cativante ela era. “Não consigo acreditar quão feliz estou. Para ser capaz de ir à mesma escola que o reverido Kushida-senpai...” disse o Yagami. “Oh, não, isso é um pouco, eu não sou nada especial...” ela respondeu humildemente. No entanto, se o Yagami realmente tivesse frequentado a mesma escola secundária como a Kushida, então algumas preocupações surgiram à cabeça. “Esta criança de Yagami sabe sobre você sabe o quê?” Perguntei-lhe ao Horikita. Eu estava a referir-me ao passado da Kushida, claro. Na secundária, a Kushida tinha levado a sua classe a se virar a si mesma e a descompor. Como resultado, ela considerou o Horikita – que tinha frequentado a mesmaSe Yagami tivesse frequentado o mesmo liceu, não seria surpresa se ele também soubesse o que aconteceu, mas... \"\" Não seria estranho se o tivesse feito. \"\" Dize Horikita. Neste caso, o facto de Yagami estar aqui certamente não era muito confortante para a Kushida. \"\" Como há estudantes no nosso nível de ensino \"\" que já tinham frequentado as mesmas escolas antes, \"\" suponho que \"\" não fora fora fora da questão \"\" para os antigos alunos \"\" se fossem inscritos. \"\" Eu sei que isto é muito repentino, \"\" mas devo dizer que não iria ter nem queixas nem preocupações \"\" se eu fosse capaz de formar uma equipa com alguém como você, Kushida-senpai. Seriam dispostos a colaborar comigo \"\", perguntou Yagami.Embora ele e a Kushida tivessem acabado de se reunir, ele pediu-se para se tornar parceiros, esticando a mão com um sorriso amigável na cara. Isto era tudo para mostrar que não sabia nada sobre o passado dela? Ou que, mesmo se ele sabia, não importava? \"Estão mesmo bem com a parceria comigo, embora? Quer dizer, Yagami-kun, talvez seria melhor se tivessem a parceria com alguém mais no seu nível académico?\" disse a Kushida. O Yagami Takuya tinha uma nota de capacidade académica extremamente elevada de A. Nada para ser ridiculizado. Não admira que a Kushida estivesse a ser tão humilde. Horikita, que tinha o telemóvel para fora, olhou para a sua informação na aplicação OAA enquanto ela ficou ao meu lado, e confirmou que era altamente classificado. \"Não sei o meu caminho aqui de todo. Então, gostaria de parceria com alguémA aplicação pode dar-vos uma ideia da capacidade académica de uma pessoa, mas não da sua natureza. Ele tem que ter decidido que seria melhor formar uma equipa com um conhecido que ele podia ter a certeza de produzir resultados sólidos. \"Um, bem, podiam dar-me algum tempo para pensar sobre...?\" Talvez porque ela estava atento a Yagami, ou por alguma outra razão, Kushida colocou a sua oferta em espera para o momento. \" Claro, isso seria perfeitamente bem. Eu irei parar em parceria com qualquer outra pessoa por um tempo, e esperar a vossa resposta, Kushida-senpai.\" Yagami concordou em colocar a oferta em espera, indicando que estava bem a esperar. Considerando que a sua capacidade académica era A-rang, não havia necessidade para ele ir correr e encontrar um parceiro.\"\" Bolas, isso deve ser simpático. Se fosse eu, \"\" eu iria juntar-me sem pensar mais \"\". Sudou pareceu invejado com a capacidade de Kushida de fazer uma oferta em espera. Isso fazia sentido, considerando que a sua classificação era apenas E+. \"\" Nesse caso, deviam trabalhar mais, \"\" disse Horikita. \"\" Sim... \"\" Eu iria certamente melhorar as minhas notas, \"\" ele respondeu. Não foi um comentário sem sentido. Sudou estava zangado porque tinha o desejo de melhorar-se a si mesmo. Afastei-me de Horikita e dos outros por um momento porque vi o Haruka a mágar-me para vir. O resto do grupo Ayanokouji toda ficou a uma pequena distância: Akito, Keisei, e Airi. \"H- ele era super assustador, não era ele?\" A primeira\"\" Claro, parece que há um monte de \"\" troublemakers \"\" como o Sudou-kun e o Ryuuen-kun no grupo de novos alunos deste ano, sim? \"\" O Haruka ficou um pouco exasperado depois de ter visto toda a agitação a acontecer. Estava ao lado dela o Akito. Ele não se movia, olhando fixamente no sítio do sal onde Housen uma vez estava. \"\" O que é que se passa, Miyacchi? \"\", perguntou o Haruka. \"\" Um tipo muito assustador veio à nossa escola. Vamos dizer apenas que as coisas provavelmente vão ficar rochosas de aqui para fora. Este tipo... Bem, ele é tão duro que até o Sudou ou o Ryuuen não o pode levar \"\", disse o Akito. \"\" Espere, espere. Não me diga que também sabes este tipo, Miyachi.\"\" De qualquer forma, havia um líder de gangue na minha escola... \"\" A pequena versão da história é que este homem era um bisbilho que parecia muito duro \"\" e que era suposto ser muito bom numa luta. Mas um dia, ele simplesmente desapareceu de repente. Isso causou um grande barulho. Depois de ele desaparecer, ouvi-o ficar no hospital \"\" depois de ter \"\" apagado \"\" em uma luta um a um com um tipo chamado Housen, que estava a correr uma luta. Este Housen tinha aparentemente acabado de começar no nosso liceu. Ele era um anjo de dois anos mais novo do que o outro tipo. \"\" O líder de gangue? Meu, isso é como alguma coisa \"\" que vem de uma manga sobre \"\" bons tipos de gangues \"\"... \"\" Isso é um pouco assustador \"\", disse Haruka. \"\" O lugar em que eu costumava\"E assim mesmo, Housen andou por todas as escolas secundárias da área, umas atrás das outras, endurecendo o seu controlo em todas elas,\" disse Akito. \"Ryuuen-kun's pretty infamous too, isn' t he? But it seems like they have never meet before,\" disse Haruka. \"I get the feeling that' s ’cause they just never happened to run into each other,\" disse Akito. \"By the way, did you used to be a bad dude yourself, Miyachi?\" perguntou Haruka. \"I... I quit doing that kinda stuff. These days I’m tryin’ to be a proper student.\" \"So, you were a delinquent.\" \"...I had a bad temper all the way up into my second-year of junior high. Since then, I’ve focused everything into archery,\"Não, na verdade, como... acho que está bem? Se alguma coisa, acho que tem um passado muito fixe. Não acham?\" disse Haruka. \"Não é fixe de todo,\" disse Akito. Eu estava a calcular que a razão pela qual ele sabia tanto sobre luta era porque costumava ser esse tipo de pessoa. Podíamos certamente dizer olhando para ele que tinha nervos de aço e reflexos rápidos. \"Quero dizer, já que eras um ex-majo mau, não poderias apenas dar a Housen um gosto da sua própria medicina, se necessário?\" perguntou Haruka. \"Desistir de brincar.\" Mesmo se eu lutar com alguém, eu escolho os meus oponentes cuidadosamente. E eu especialmente não gostaria de lutar contra Housen, de certeza, \"\" disse Akito.Akito levantou a bandeira branca antes mesmo de a luta ter acontecido. Ele estava a dizer que menos como um reconhecimento da sua própria fraqueza, no entanto, e mais devido ao reconhecimento da força de Housen. Ibuki também tinha um certo nível de perfeição quando se tratava de combate de mão em mão, e ela não tinha sido capaz de aterrar um único ataque. Havia apenas uma enorme diferença nas suas fisiões. E ela não era uma ligação para ele quando se tratava de velocidade também.4.3Depois do fim da aula, eu fui abordado pela Horikita, tal como ontem. Quando estávamos prestes a sair da sala de aula juntos, Sudou insistiu em acompañar-nos também. Horikita tentou recusar-o, mas tal como a última vez, parecia estar ganha pela sua vontade de ajudar até encontrar um parceiro. Ela deixou-o ir comigo sob a condição de que ele não iria interferir com as suas atividades do clube ou os seus estudos. Foi certamente surpreendente para a Horikita ser tão amável, ou talvez eu deveria dizer aceitar.Mas eu supus que havia uma boa razão para ela permitir-lhe vir. Tinham faltado cerca de dez dias até ao exame especial. Considerando o quão excecionalmente difícil seria o exame escrito, era uma boa ideia assegurar um tempo e um lugar onde seria possível concentrar-se nos estudos, mesmo que apenas por um pouco. Mas se Sudou estivesse constantemente preocupado com o que Horikita estava a fazer, ele não seria capaz de se concentrar. Era claro ver que Horikita queria encontrar um parceiro para o Sudou o mais rápido possível, para que ele pudesse ter tempo de se dedicar a seus estudos. Horikita compreendia Sudou Ken muito bem - exceto uma coisa particularmente importante. Chama-se, os sentimentos de Sudou para Horikita. Ela não tinha percebido que havia uma razão, no fundo, por que ele só queria estar ao seu lado.Claro, eu não ia indicar deliberadamente o que era uma força motriz importante para Sudou. Em vez de ir para as salas de aula do primeiro ano, Horikita decidiu ir para o Keyaki Mall, talvez porque alguns primeiros anos tinham causado um pouco de problemas depois de virem para o nosso chão hoje durante o almoço. Ela estava a ser cuidadosa para se certificar que um incidente semelhante não tinha acontecido. Ou talvez fosse o problema da criança Housen, da classe 1 D, que tinha causado a Horikita a mudar de opinião. Suponho que iríamos descobrir em breve. Assim que entramos no centro comercial, Sudou colocou o pequeno dedo da sua mão esquerda no ouvido para tentar bloquear alguns dos sons, parecendo um pouco irritado pelo barulho. Ele depois deu os seus pensamentos honestos sobre os novos alunos que vimos e sobre a nossa frente.\"\" Claro que há bastantes estudantes por aí \"\", respondeu Horikita. Estavam por todo o lado, a conversar felizmente, a falar sobre coisas como o que queriam comprar ou o que queriam comer. \"\" E, no entanto, estamos todos a procurar \"\" por aqui \"\", acentou Sudou. Desfrutar, dia após dia, a tentar decidir sobre um parceiro não foi bom nem para os anos segundo, nem para os primeiros. No entanto, havia um enorme ponto de separação entre os anos primeiro e segundo. Esta foi a diferença na nossa perceção dos exames especiais. Muito poucos dos novos estudantes sentiram um profundo sentido de urgência, tal como os que tínhamos visto ontem, depois da aula. Este facto foi ainda mais evidente quando fomos à pé para fora do edifício da escola. \"\" Não é de admiração. Quer dizer, foi o mesmo para nós, quando éramos os novos miúdoCom a enorme quantia de dinheiro depositada nas suas contas logo depois de se terem inscrito aqui, os novos estudantes estavam a gastar dia após dia em busca de diversão. Mesmo se estavam na classe A, quase não havia diferença. Independentemente de como eles estavam a usar os seus pontos, o facto foi que todos eles estavam a desfrutar do que esta escola tinha de oferecer ao máximo. O mais irritante de tudo, no entanto, foi o facto de haver uma diferença nas penas que tivemos de enfrentar e as que os novos estudantes fizeram. Enfrentámos a expulsão, enquanto tudo o que eles estavam a perder eram três meses de pontos privados. \"\" Olhem para eles, não tem um interesse no mundo, homem, \"\" disse Sudou. \"\" Eu não estaria a falar se eu fosse você, Sudou-kun. Já te esqueceste do que eras como há um ano atrás? \"\" disse Horikita.Provavelmente porque ele foi o primeiro aluno na nossa turma a ser confrontado com a ameaça real de ser expulso. A medida de alivio que tínhamos utilizado na altura já não estava disponível para nós, claro. O privilégio de ser principiantes já estava esgotado. \"\" Para o momento, vamos tentar falar com um grupo de pessoas \"\", disse Horikita, a ver um grupo de três rapazes do primeiro ano sentados num banco, a conversar e a rir entre si mesmos. Os seus nomes eram Kaga, Mikami, e Shiratori. Eram todos estudantes na turma 1-D e todos tinham um ranking de capacidade académica de B- ou melhor. Antes de chamar a estes estudantes, Horikita colocou a sua informação na aplicação, só para ter a certeza. Parecia que não se tinha mudado de ideias em ir atrás dos estudantes da turma 1-D, depois de tudo. \"\" Desculpem, têm algum momentoEles podiam provavelmente dizer apenas olhando para nós que estavam a lidar com homens de topo. As expressões alegres desapareceram quietamente dos seus rostos e foram rapidamente substituídas por olhares de precaução. “Estamos à procura de parceiros para o próximo teste especial. Já encontraste parceiros a vocês mesmos?” perguntou ela. “Oh, uh, não. Ainda não temos parceiros com ninguém, ” disse um dos estudantes. “Se quisessem, estaríamos encantados de vos falar sobre a parceria, ” disse Horikita. “Sim, estariamos bem com isso. Certo?” disse um dos estudantes. Depois de ouvir a proposta de Horikita, os três deles asentiram-se em resposta, quase como se tivessem discutido as coisas com antecedência. Obtivemos uma boa vibração inesperada da sua resposta, e pareceu que eles tinham relaxado um pouco a sua guarda. Sudou\"\" Mas, embora me disculpa dizer isto, \"a nossa primeira prioridade agora é encontrar...\" \"Partners que possam ajudar os estudantes com notas fracas para os impedir de serem expulsados, certo?\" disse um dos estudantes, terminando a frase de Horikita. Parecia que a ideia já se tinha espalhado entre os novos estudantes. \"Sim. Se perceberam isso, então esta discussão será rápida,\" disse Horikita. \"Um, bem... então, gostaríamos... de que um de nós se juntasse a Sudou-senpai?\" perguntou um dos estudantes. Também verificaram os nossos perfiles nos seus telemóveis, o que foi a razão pela qual não tiveram hesitation em falar connosco. \"Sim. Ele é um dos estudantes para os quais gostaríamos de encontrar um parceiro. Existem muitos outros, também, \"\" disse Horikita. \"Oh, ok, eu vejo. Vamos ver,Ele estava a ser diplomático, mas ainda era claro que estava a apontar o quão baixo era o ranking de capacidades académicas de Sudou. Embora o que ele disse fosse verdade, Sudou parecia aborrecido. No entanto, ele mal conseguia mantê-lo junto e não deixar que a sua insatisfação se mostrasse na sua cara. “Shiratori, você deveria ser capaz de lidar com isso bem, certo?” Os outros dois estudantes olharam para Shiratori, que estava no extremo direito da bancada. “A minha capacidade académica é A, pelo menos para o momento presente, ” disse Shiratori. “Sim, então parece. Se você estiver disposto a parceria com ele, eu certamente não me iria queixar, ” disse Horikita. “ Nesse caso... que tal coisa?” Shiratori levantou a mão com os cinco dedos acima, fazendo uma proposta em troca. Por um momento, Hori\"O meu oh meu. Queres parceria, não é? Se sim, devo pensar que algo assim seria óbvio. Não?\" disse Shiratori. Quando Horikita ouviu isso, percebeu o que ele queria dizer. \"... Supoço que estás a falar de Pontos Privos.\" \" Claro. Quero dizer, se alguém como eu for formar uma equipa com um aluno inteligente, eu poderia disparar para o topo. Como eu vou desistir de uma hipótese de receber recompensas no topo ao associar-me a um aluno com um nível académico baixo, é só natural que eu peço algo em troca,\" disse Shiratori. \"Diz o quê? Queres Pontos de nós?! E você está a falar de 50 000...? Meu senhor, isso é muito, \"\" disse Sudou. Para alguém como o Sudou, que estava constantemente em baixo de fundos todos os dias, foi um número extraordinário de\"\" Eu queria dizer cinco mil. Se me puderem dar cinco mil, \"\" eu estarei felizmente em parceria convosco aqui e agora, \"\" disse Shiratori. \"\" Cinquenta mil? \"\", gritou Sudou. \"\" Seria muito difícil para vocês \"\" se um aluno fosse expulsado da vossa turma, certo? \"\" Estamos a fazer um pouco de pesquisa nós próprios, vocês veem, \"\" disse Shiratori. Aparentemente, o batalho de novos alunos deste ano foi muito diferente do que tínhamos sido no ano passado. Eles já começaram a perceber como esta escola funcionava, e, além disso, perceberam o seu valor. Entre o nosso nível de ensino e o deles, foi difícil dizer quem de nós era o senior e quem o junior. Olhando para a situação em que estávamos, podia facilmente ser interpretado ao contrário.\"\" É certamente natural querer algum tipo de remuneração \"\" se você está a ser pedido a colaborar com alguém com um nível de capacidade académica baixo \"\", disse Horikita. \"H-hey, Suzune! Eu não tenho 500 grandes mas, sabes?\" disse Sudou. \"\" Eu sei isso. Fique calado por um minuto \"\", disse Horikita. Os três estudantes do primeiro ano usaram sorrisos sarcásticos e furiosos nas suas caras depois de ouvirem o Sudou desconhecer as suas circunstâncias financeiras. \"\" É só natural querer pontos, sim. No entanto, está perseguir desejos de curto prazo realmente uma boa ideia \"\", disse Horikita. \"O que é que isso significa?\" perguntou Shiratori, falando como representante dos três estudantes.\"O que significa que, se vocês se relacionarem connosco aqui e agora, poderemos dar-vos ajuda ao longo da estrada, em situações semelhantes\", disse Horikita, explicando-lhes que seria em sua vantagem mais tarde se eles fossem trocar alguma dá-e-valor com nós numa forma diferente de Pontos Privos. \"Bem, pôr-vos de lado, Horikita-senpai, já que vocês têm um ranking A, não consigo realmente imaginar que ter Sudou-senpai ou Ayanokouji-senpai seria realmente de qualquer ajuda para nós. Não diriam?\" disse Shiratori. \"Não é necessariamente verdade. Esta escola não é apenas sobre académicos. Há alturas em que vão precisar de capacidade física também,\" disse Horikita. Isso foi particularmente aplicável ao Sudou, porque ele era o único aluno do nosso nível que tinha um A + em capacidade física. Horikita tinha o\"\" Eu sei isso. Mas ainda és apenas classe D no fim, certo? \"\" Se nos quisessemos agradar a nós próprios, seria classe A ou classe B, \"\" disse Shiratori calmamente, tendo vindo a chegar a uma conclusão objetiva.Vendo que Horikita provavelmente compreendia. \"\"... Eu sei. Então é assim que é \"\". Considerando como eles se comportaram regularmente depois de ouvir a nossa oferta e o número de pontos que regressaram como contra-oferta, \"\" não precisamos de pensar muito sobre o que estava a acontecer aqui. \"O que é que quer dizer com isso?\" perguntou Sudou. \"\" Antes de chegar, foram-nos abordados por estudantes seniores de outras turmas, \"\" disse Shiratori. \"\" E eles disseram-lhes para não vender as suas capacidades académicas por barato. Certo?\" perguntou Horikita. \"SimAo enfrentar o Shiratori e os seus colegas de turma, Horikita manteve a sua calma, e depois continuou a falar. \"\" É certamente verdade que não deverias vender-te a baixo custo, nesse caso. No entanto, eram mesmo abordados por outros estudantes da nossa turma, no entanto?\" disse Horikita. \"O que é que quer dizer com isso?\" perguntou o Shiratori. Ele parecia irritado, como se a sua orgulho como um estudante de classe A tivesse sido ferido. \"\" Vocês também estão na classe D, tal como nós. Não consigo imaginar estudantes de turmas de maior nível que vos tivessem abordado tão ocasionalmente, \"\" disse Horikita.Horikita estava a abalar. Enquanto tivéssemos um nível elevado de capacidade académica, seria útil ter à volta neste exame, independentemente se estivesse na classe D. Ela estava a tentar confirmar quem os tinha falado, e\"\" É verdade, no entanto. Fomos convidados pelo Hashimoto-senpai da classe 2A. No topo disso, fomos abordados pelos estudantes da classe 2C, \"\" que nos ofereceram bastantes pontos para nos associarem com eles. Não é isso certo?\", disse Shiratori, olhando para os seus amigos, que ambos manifestaram imediatamente o seu acordo. \"\" Nós também não somos os únicos. A maioria das crianças inteligentes foram abordadas \"\", acrescentou Shiratori. Tal como Horikita tinha calculado, a classe 2A e a classe C tinham pensado em tentar comprar estudantes fora. \"\" Eu vejo... \"\" Neste caso, suponho que não podemos responder às suas expectativas neste preciso momento, \"\" disse Horikita. \"\" Oh, mas enquanto nos dás pontos, não te recusaremos. Nós pretendemos ver como as coisas vão por cerca de uma semana. Se nos fizessem\"\" Quinhentos mil pontos para impedir que alguém seja expulsado. Uma grande quantia para ser seguro, mas se olharem para isso de outro ângulo, podem dizer que foi o preço da vossa segurança. Contudo, não podíamos tomar uma decisão rápida aqui. Nem queríamos fazer. \"\" A propósito... Quantos pontos Hashimoto-kun e os outros oferecem-vos para a vossa cooperação? \"\", perguntou Horikita. Ela estava a esperar saber o número específico de pontos que foram oferecedos, mas Shiratori e os seus amigos não eram assim tão ingénuos. \"\" Nós prometemos não dizer. Tudo o que eu vou dizer é que, para quinhentos mil pontos, vamos ajudar-vos, \"\" disse Shiratori. \"\" Eu compreendo. Eu vou ter isso em conta. Contudo, gostaríamos de pedir-vos um favor. Seriam dispostos a nos apresentar alguns dos vossos\"\" Nós já estávamos preparados para trabalhar com a nossa turma, até certo ponto. Mas aproximar-nos de cada pessoa individualmente e explicar a mesma coisa vezes sem conta, iria levar muito tempo e energia. Se possível, gostaríamos de vos juntar a todos num sítio e então ter uma discussão mais concreta \"\", disse Horikita. Ela tinha sugerido a ideia de formar uma parceria, mas não disse especificamente como seria. Os três estudantes trocaram olhos, embora todos pareçam desconfortáveis sobre algo. \"\" Isto é... Bem, pedir-nos que façamos algo assim pode ser um pouco difícil... Certo, rapazes?\" \"Sim. Se formos avançar e fazer algo assim sem obter autorização, Housen-kun vai provavelmente ficar chateado connosco. Não acham?\" O nome 'Housen' apareceu na conversa que eles estavam a ter entre si.\"\" Desculpa, senpai, mas poderes, por favor, pedir a outra pessoa para se preocupar com isso... \"\", perguntou Shiratori. Parece que Housen foi o que teve as mangas da classe 1 D, afinal. Horikita, sentindo que o humor tinha mudado claramente, decidiu não continuar a perseguir a questão. \"\" Obrigado. \"\" Eu vou-vos telefonar novamente se houver necessidade, \"\" disse ela. \"\" Está bem. Vamos ficar à espera, \"\" disse Shiratori. Afastemo-nos do banco e começámos a dirigir-nos para o café no segundo andar. Perguntei-lhes secretamente quando partimos, \"\" e vi que a Shiratori, com o telemóvel à mão, parecia estar a telefonar urgentemente a alguém. \"\" Tivemos alguma informação, \"\" mas é difícil dizer que fizemos algum progresso\"\" Eles estão totalmente a tentar tirar partido de nós e da manipulação do preço, fazendo \"\" estas exigências ridículas \"\", disse Sudou. \"\" Claro que é uma quantia ridícula que eles estão a pedir, sim. Mas também é verdade que não têm razão para vender os seus talentos a baixo custo, \"\" disse Horikita. Ainda mais, se eles estiveram classificados como \"\" A \"\" na capacidade académica. Esta foi certamente uma forma muito mais directa de ganhar pontos do que disparar para a recompensa de 100 000 pontos \"\" por obter notas elevadas no exame. \"\" Então, no fim, a única forma para mim salvar-me é pagando a alguém um monte de Pontos Privos \"\", perguntou Sudou. \"\" Claro que está a ficar cada vez mais difícil de dizer com certeza que há estudantes lá fora que vos ajudarão gratuitamente. \"\"A noção de que os pontos seriam a chave para formar parcerias já se tinha espalhado. Seria melhor se pensássemos que não era só o Shiratori e os seus amigos que acreditavam nisto, mas que o seu nível de ensino inteiro sabia pedir pontos em troca de parcerias. Estava certo de que podíamos dizer com segurança que isso era parte da estratégia de Sakayanagi e Ryuuen também. Normalmente, fazerem coisas em troca de pontos era afastado. Estas transações trouxeram-lhes um sentido de vergonha, e por isso, eram normalmente feitas em segredo. Mas, ao conduzir uma operação de compra em grande escala, eles essencialmente fizeram com que os novos estudantes se apercebam de que a oferecer os seus serviços gratuitamente iria perder.Mesmo assim, havia algo que me incomodava sobre a conversa que tínhamos feito com o Shiratori e os seus colegas no início. Embora eles já tivessem sido abordados por estudantes de outras turmas, disseram que iriam esperar uma semana. Mesmo que eles estivessem apenas à espera tanto para poderem tentar pescar mais pontos, fiquei preocupado pelo facto de que os três deles pareciam estar em acordo sobre o seu curso de ação a partir do início. Eu iria pensar que os estudantes teriam querido procurar a tranquilização encontrando um parceiro imediatamente. Será que esses três em particular aconteceram ser massacrados? Ou talvez... \" Mesmo que continuemos a perguntar aleatóriamente assim, provavelmente vamos continuar a receber as mesmas respostas, não vamos?\" Disse-lhes.Scoping out Class 1-D was fun and all, but the real problem came after that. O que Shiratori and his friends said about Housen getting angry with them if they acted without permission stuck in my mind. Judging from the way Shiratori and his friends talked, I was certain that Housen Kazuomi oversaw their entire class. “Housen likely gave his classmates some instructions,” I added. “He probably told them something like, ‘Hey, you can team up with anybody you want, but you can only make a snap decision to team up if they offer you five hundred thousand points. If they don’t make that offer, put their request to team up on hold, even if they’re from Class A,’ or something like that. “But wait, if they do that, won’t that mean Class 1-D gets left behind?” asked Sudou. “I’m saying they’re\"\" É só nós, estudantes do segundo ano, \"\" que temos medo de ser atingidos com a pena \"\" por não encontrarmos um parceiro. \"\" Ele estava provavelmente a pensar \"\" que pode ficar por cima das nossas cabeças \"\" e usá-lo para nos arrancar para o máximo de Pontos Privos possível no final \"\", disse-lhe. \"\" Se todos os alunos de honra \"\" fora da Classe 1 D \"\" já tivessem sido comprados, \"\" nós, eventualmente, \"\" não teríamos outra opção, \"\" mas arranhá-los para que os da Classe D \"\" cooperem connosco, quer gostassemos disso, quer não. \"\" Mesmo que isso signifique \"\" pagar um milhão ou dois milhões \"\". \"\" É uma estratégia incrivelmente rápida, \"\" feita sem pensar nada no que vai acontecer no futuro \"\", disse Horikita. \"Já tínhamos percebido o que a classe 1-D estava a planear fazer. Portanto, tendo isso em conta, quis saber o que a Horikita estava a pensar. Será que ela tentaria forçar-se a entre o que a classe 2-A e a classe C estavam a começar a fazer agora mesmo, com as suas estratégias de \"\" buy-out \"\" extremas? Ou será que talvez adoteça uma estratégia mais como a que a Ichinose estava a fazer, formando relações baseadas na confiança ao aceitar muitos alunos mais baixos, independentemente da classe em que estavam, e apelando aos alunos de honra para a sua cooperação? \"\" Decidi estabelecer três objetivos quando ouvimos o desenho para este exame especial \"\", disse Horikita. \"\" Três objetivos \"\", perguntou Sudou. Ele parecia estar interessado no que ela estava prestes a dizer, porque estava a inclinar-se\"\" Sim, claro, \"\" respondeu Sudou, a acenar. \"\" A segunda é disparar para o terceiro lugar ou melhor em pontos globais, \"\" na competição contra outras classes, \"\" disse Horikita. \"\" Espere, terceiro? Queres dizer que estamos a atirar a nossa foto de ir atrás do primeiro ou segundo direito do regresso?\" perguntou Sudou. \"\" Ninguém disse nada sobre atirar a nossa foto de ir atrás daqueles lugares. \"\" Eu disse \"\" Terceiro lugar ou melhor \"\", disse Horikita. \"\" É verdade, a dizer que estava a esperar para o terceiro lugar ou melhor \"\" incluíndo técnicamente o primeiro e o segundo lugar. Mas isso não parecia ser precisamente o que ela queria dizer, \"\" e tinha provavelmente alguma coisa a ver com o seu terceiro objetivo. \"\" O meu terceiro objetivo é evitar participar nestes jogos de dinheiro\"\" Eu entendo o que querem dizer. Quer dizer, que se não vamos competir usando Pontos Privos, \"\" então não temos esperança de ganhar esta coisa. No entanto, mesmo se tentarmos competir usando os Pontos que temos, a recompensa não vale a pena o risco. Mesmo que terminemos no primeiro lugar, em geral, só ganhamos 50 Pontos de Classe. O que significa que ao longo de um ano, a nossa classe só recebe um pouco mais de 2 milhões de Pontos Privos, \"\" disse Horikita. Se obtivéssemos 5 000 Pontos por pessoa por mês, (excluindo o depósito que obtivemos em abril, que já tinha passado) e multiplicássemos essa quantia pelo resto dos 11 meses, então acabaríamos com 2 milhões, 100 e 45 000 Pontos Privos.\"E se pagarmos cinco centenas de milhares de pontos por pessoa, isso significa que estaríamos no vermelho depois de pagarmos cinco pessoas. Não podemos ser tão ingénuos como pensar que poderíamos ganhar esta coisa apenas por obter quatro ou assim anos de primeiro ano que têm uma classificação de capacidade académica de A, certo?\" disse Horikita. Mesmo se tivéssemos de levar isso para os próximos dois anos - isto é, até termos acabado o curso - ainda seria apenas quatro milhões, quatro centenas e 85 mil pontos privados. O que cubria um máximo de oito recrutos. além disso, tudo isto estava baseado na suposição de que não só podíamos certamente obter esses estudantes a cinco centenas de milhares no máximo, mas também, que estariamos a ficar no primeiro lugar na classificação geral pelo nível de ensino. Considerando os riscos, seria provavelmente muito mais eficiente para nós simplesmente esperar a um próximo exame especial e usar os nossos pontos\"Os pontos privados e os pontos de classe não são iguais. Estou bem ciente de que existe mais do que aquilo que obtemos em troca. No entanto, acho que mesmo se fizermos bombar todos os nossos pontos neste teste, teríamos apenas uma pequena hipótese de ganhar, por isso não deveríamos tentar e empurrá-lo. Estou errado, Ayanokouji-kun?\" perguntou Horikita. \"Não, de todo. A tua decisão é a certa,\" respondei. A diferença na capacidade académica geral entre nós e a classe 2-A havia sido clara desde o início. Se quiséssemos ganhar em geral, não podia imaginar que ganharíamos muito de uma vantagem por trazer oito estudantes. Claro, Horikita era engenhosa. Ela iria provavelmente considerar em pagar pontos privados se houvesse estudantes que estivessem dispostos a parceria para 50 ou 100 mil. Era só que ela não queria esta batalha\"\" Para alcançar esses três objectivos, acho que deveríamos, afinal, tentar negociar com a classe 1 D \"\", disse Horikita. \"\" Mas porque é que? \"\" Ninguém dos miúdos na sua classe disse a Housen \"\" de não juntar-se a nós \"para alguma coisa menos de 500 grandes?\" disse Sudou. \"\" Quanto aos alunos de honra, sim, isso é verdade. \"\" No entanto, há estudantes na sua classe \"\" que também têm uma classificação de capacidades académicas de C ou abaixo, \"\". \"O que é que acham que aconteceria se fossem negligenciados?\" perguntou Horikita. \"O que aconteceria...?\" repetiu Sudou. \"Os estudantes que deveriam estar normalmente bem seriam também castigados, \"\" e a sua posição seria colocada em questão, \"\" eu respondi. Horikita asentiu o que\"\" Não há hipótese \"\" de estes estudantes desistirem voluntariamente dos Pontos Privos \"\" que podiam obter todos os meses. O que significa que, a certa altura, o Housen-kun não terá outra opção senão abandonar a sua posição actual \"\", disse Horikita. Mesmo se todos os alunos de honras em 1D tentaram vender-se por cinco centenas de milhares de pontos, o resto dos alunos na sua classe não podiam fazer o mesmo. Se pôr de lado a questão de se os alunos do segundo ano seriam expulsados ou não, o Housen ficaria para trás na batalha entre os primeiros anos. \"\" Se ele estiver à procura de uma forma de ganhar, \"\" haverá certamente uma abertura que podemos explorar \"\", disse Horikita. Parecia que ela estava a tratar com a classe 1D então, a classe que todos os outros queriam evitar. \"\" Isto sendo dito,Se as nossas negociações falharem, seriam os estudantes com menos competências académicas que ficariam em sarilhos. \"\" Considerando que o período de exame apenas começou, acho que não é estranho que algumas crianças estejam a pedir condições totalmente irrazoáveis para se juntarem \"\", disse Horikita. \"Bem, espero que estejam certos... Quero dizer, no que me preocupo, \"\" mas duvido que haja alguém por aí para mim \"\", disse Sudou. \"En qualquer caso, a única forma de encontrarmos parceiros de talento é chegar a muita gente,\" disse Horikita.Quando nos voltámos, vimos uma estudante solteira a olhar para nós, com um grande sorriso na cara, de orelha a orelha. Assim que os nossos olhos se viram, ela a pouco a pouco subiu os passos. Horikita foi a primeira de nós a deixar as suas suspeitas aparecer no seu rosto. \"\" Estavam a escutar-nos? \"\", perguntou. \"\" Oh, meu Deus, não, senpai, eu só gritei porque só me aconteceu de ouvir o que estavas a dizer é tudo. E umm...\" A rapariga falava sem olhar para Sudou ou para mim, mantendo o seu olhar fechado para Horikita. \"Senpai, qual é o teu nome e classificação de capacidades académicas?\" \"... O meu nome é Horikita. Eu sou da classe 2D. A minha pontuação de capacidades académicas é A-. O queEla parece-se com uma rapariga que só se preocupa com a popularidade, mas que na verdade é muito inteligente. Só para ter a certeza, Horikita verificou a sua informação na aplicação. \"\" Se quiserem disparar para o topo, eu vou trabalhar convosco. Ok?\" Amasawa colocou-se nessa pergunta sem sequer perguntar nada sobre os nossos conhecimentos. Se os estudantes com classificações A- e A juntarem-se, certamente não seria impossível eles ficarem no primeiro lugar. Quanto à Horikita, ela tinha deliberadamente baixado a sua pontuação por causa de Sudou no passado, por isso, se tivéssemos em consideração este facto, não seria injusto dizer que ela era realmente uma A, não uma A-.Embora isto fosse inesperado, Horikita poderia muito bem acabar por arranjar um parceiro para si mesma, não para Sudou ou para qualquer outra pessoa. Isto pode ser uma coincidência, mas um estudante com uma classificação de capacidade académica de A chegou mesmo a ela. Se Horikita quisesse dizer que, em vez disso, queria que Amasawa associasse-se a um estudante com uma classificação mais baixa, Amasawa poderia escolher sair. “Agradeço sinceramente a proposta, mas, na verdade, não estou a procurar um parceiro agora mesmo. No entanto, em vez de me associar a mim, poderia eu, possivelmente, vos perguntar sobre a parceria com ele... Com Sudou-kun?” perguntou Horikita.Horikita tomou esse risco, de qualquer forma, introduzindo a rapariga para Sudou. Embora Sudou estivesse um pouco perplexo pela situação, ele gentilmente\"\" E+. Certamente não é uma boa nota, de qualquer forma, \"\" disse Horikita. \"\" Não é boa \"\" estava a pô-la suavemente. Se alguma coisa, ele estava a correr para a pior classe na nossa classe inteira. \"\" Eu te encontrei. Então isso significa que estás à procura de ajuda, Horikita-senpai. Estás a tentar encontrar um parceiro para ele para que não seja expulsado da escola. \"\" Amasawa, a perceber a situação, olhou para o Sudou. \"\" E+, huh. Se nos juntarmos, esqueçamos de chegar ao topo. Nós provavelmente acabáríamos por tirar um pouco de pontuação no meio da estrada. \"\" Sim, isso é verdade. Quase não há qualquer vantagem para ti \"\", disse Horikita. Perguntei-me se a Amasawa ia subir pontos agora, mas não haviaAs coisas pareciam-nos muito mais favorables para nós do que a forma como foram com aqueles três rapazes antes. Amasawa olhou então para mim. \"O que é com ele? Está também à procura de um parceiro?\" perguntou ela. \"O seu ranking de capacidades académicas é C. Ele não é exatamente uma prioridade para nós. No entanto, se o Sudou-kun for um não-go para si, continuaríamos a ser muito gratos se tivéssemos uma equipa com o Ayanokouji-kun, como um cenário no pior dos casos,\" disse Horikita. \"Aspette, não, segure...\" eu respondi, cortando. embora isto fosse provavelmente um gesto simpático da parte de Horikita, eu tive de lhe pôr um fim. Não podia simplesmente decidir um parceiro agora mesmo sem pensar nisso. \"É alguma coisa errada com ela?\" perguntou\"Oh, hei, esperem um segundo. Ainda não disse com quem vou casar, embora, sabem?\" Amasawa, vendo que a conversa estava a avançar sem o seu consentimento real sobre a questão, disse e parou e parou. \"Has alguma situação que precisasse de ser cumprida para parceriar com um destes dois?\" perguntou Horikita. \"Condições, condições, huh. Sim, ok. Suponho que tenho direito a pelo menos tanto, certo?\" disse Amasawa.Horikita tinha decidido abordar o tema ela própria, para ver se a Amasawa tinha alguma situação para uma parceria. Ela não tinha mudado a sua política básica de evitar envolver-se numa competição de gastos com as outras classes usando Pontos Privados, mas se o preço da Amasawa era suficientemente baixo, havia espaço para ser considerado. Eu apenas me tinha pedido que não fosse um preço muito\"\" Bem, eu gosto mesmo de pessoas fortes, sabes, \"\" disse Amasawa, dizendo algo que não teve absolutamente nada a ver com este exame enquanto estava a usar um pequeno sorriso devilheiro. \"O que é que estás a falar?\" a Horikita suspedentemente fez a sobrancelha, tendo esperado que o tema da discussão passe de estudos a pontos. \"Bem, é como, eu estava a arruinar o meu cérebro sobre o que eu deveria fazer para este exame e coisas assim. Estava a pensar, devia eu estudar muito duro, juntar-me a alguém em torno de um classe A como Horikita-senpai, e tentar disparar para o topo?... ou, tipo, devia eu fazer algo de fácil, simplesmente tentar passar pelo exame? E se eu quisesse ficar a fazê-lo fácil no teste, eu gostaria de juntar-me a alguém que eu gosto\"\" Gosto de homens fortes \"\", acrescentou Amasawa, a repetir o que disse antes. Horikita virou a cabeça enquanto tentava compreender o que Amasawa estava a dizer. \"\" Significa... você está a perguntar se o Sudou-kun é forte ou não, então? \"\", perguntou Horikita. \"\" Certo. \"\" E não estou a falar de, tipo, ser mentalmente forte ou qualquer coisa. Estou a perguntar se ele é físicomente forte. Bem, posso dizer com facilidade que se fazes desporto ou coisas apenas olhando para o teu corpo físico, \"\" disse Amasawa, a apontar o dedo para o Sudou, uma estudante que normalmente deveria ser uma não-entidade para alguém com um A na sua capacidade académica. O Sudou estava confiante na sua força, então enquanto estava um pouco tímido acerca disso, nickou em acordo. \"\"\" Se você é mesmo forte, então sim \"\", disse Amasawa. Ela percorreu o fio do dedo ao longo do peito do Sudou, fascinando-o com a sua atração. \"\" Eu sou forte \"\", respondeu ele. \"\" Bem, eu não gosto de tipos que estão cheios de confiança \"\", disse Amasawa. \"\" O que quer dizer exatamente, se ele é mesmo forte \"\"? Horikita, que tinha tido a responsabilidade de colocar o Sudou no sítio, \"\" exprimiu a sua falta de compreensão do que o Amasawa estava a falar. \"\" Significa o que soa. Eu gosto de pessoas fortes que são boas numa luta. É por isso que eu quero parceria com alguém forte \"\", disse Amasawa. \"\" Nesse caso, acho que o Sudou-kun pode medir. Eu posso garantir a sua força física \"\", disse Hori\"\" Quero dizer, vai lá fora, arrume um monte de \"\" segundos \"\" fortes, façam-nos lutar uns com os outros. \"\" E depois eu juntar-me com o mais duro, \"\" disse Amasawa. \"Estas a brincar? Não há forma de podermos fazer algo assim, \"\" disse Horikita. \"Porque não? Ei, eu tenho sido sério durante todo o tempo que estivemos a falar, certo?\" disse Sudou, que não podia acreditar que Amasawa estava a ser sério também, disse. \"Vamos lá, Suzune. Ficar aqui é apenas uma perda de tempo.\" Parecia quase que ele se estava a alertar a si mesmo para caír para os charmes de Amasawa, mesmo que apenas por um momento. \"Eh, não me importa se quiseres simplesmente fingir que esta conversa nunca aconteceu,\" disse AmasEla estava a dizer que para ela, toda esta coisa não era mais do que um pouco de diversão. Ela certamente não tinha que sair do caminho para associar-se a um estudante de classificação E+, se ela quisesse. Considerando o facto de que a classe e as capacidades de Amasawa não eram nada para ser ridiculhada, ela provavelmente não teria nenhuma escassez de pessoas dispostas a pagar para estar com ela. No entanto, isso pode ser feliz para nós, até certo ponto. Se concordassemos com a sua pedido, Sudou iria ganhar o direito de associar-se a um estudante com capacidade académica de classe A. E mesmo se ele não acabara por chegar a associar-se a ela, perdemos nada.\"\" Vá lá, está bem! Quero formar uma equipa com alguém forte, afinal \"\", disse Amasawa. \"\" Está bem. \"\" Neste caso, Sudou-kun, \"\" tens que aceitar a sua oferta \"\", disse Horikita. \"\" Espere, espere, Suzune. A escola não nos vai deixar fazer apenas uma luta ou o que quer que seja. A coisa ficará muito mal se nós lutarmos, não é? Quer dizer, como o que aconteceu no ano passado, \"\" e ao almoço, \"\" com aquela luta pequena com aquele homem Housen. Certo? \"\", disse Sudou. No ano passado, Sudou tinha entrado numa luta com várias pessoas da classe de Ryuuen \"\" e tinha-se transformado num grande problema. E só hoje, havia uma grande agitação quando Housen veio. \"\" É certamente verdade que a luta não é exatamente digna de eLevei um momento para pensar quais eram as intenções de Horikita a perguntar-me essa pergunta. Se ela me perguntava se não havia nenhuma questão com uma tal luta, então a minha resposta seria obviamente que sim, haveria questões. Ganhar ou perder, mesmo que ambas as partes concordassem em lutar e depois começaram a balançar, não havia forma de que os diretores das escolas aprobaram algo que essencialmente equivalesse a um duelo. No entanto, Horikita tinha respondido a Amasawa de uma forma que soava como se estivesse a condonar a ideia de uma tal luta.\"\" Para além disso, \"\" sem importar quem escolhes do nosso nível de ensino, ninguém seria capaz de vencer o Sudou-kun numa luta \"\", disse Horikita. \"Foi bem,\" eu respondi. Sudou não compreendia o que estava a acontecer, mas Horikita e eu andávamos a passar os tacos uns para os outros nesta conversa. A coisa importante neste momento não era afirmar a ideia de ter realmente uma luta. Era provar que Sudou era o mais forte - sem ter mesmo ele a lutar contra ninguém.\"\" Para ser franca, Sudou-kun, esta é uma oportunidade de uma vez na vida. Pensem nisso. Normalmente, seria extremamente difícil combinar-vos com um aluno com capacidade académica de um nível A. No entanto, Amasawa-san disse que está disposta a parceria convosco. Percebem? Em cima disso, ela está a concordar em parceria convosco sob a condição de vocês ganharem uma luta. Um teste de força. Algo em que vocês são melhores do que qualquer outro. Deviam fazer este negócio sem hesitar, \"\" disse Horikita.Não havia hipótese de um estudante de segundo ano familiarizado com as regras da escola concordar inconscientemente em envolver-se numa luta como esta. Para além disso, se o seu oponente fosse Sudou, o resultado era tão claro como o dia. Por outras palavras... mesmo se nós concordassemos com as suas condições aqui e agora, a luta poderá nunca acabar por acontecer. E mesmo na hipótese de alguém ter tomado o desafio, Sudou pode deitá-los para baixo. \"Ooh, bom! Bom! Estou a ficar um pouco entusiasmado!\" Amasawa, depois de se ter inscrito aqui, naturalmente não sabia nada disto. Não havia hipótese de ela conseguir compreender o quão diferente este lugar era de uma escola secundária ou secundária normal. \"Mas, poderiam-nos prometer uma coisa, primeiro? Se ninguém aparecesse nesta luta além do Sudou-kun, então concordarão em parceria com ele,Se Amasawa não concordasse com essa condição, esta discussão iria continuar. \"\" Claro. Eu prometo. Se nenhum desafio aparecer, então ele vai ganhar por padrão, \"\" disse Amasawa. Depois de Amasawa nos dar a palavra, Horikita concordou, aparentemente satisfeito. \"\" Tudo bem, Sudou-kun?\" perguntou-se, virando-se para Sudou. \"... Claro. Se não tiveres um problema com isso, Suzune, então não me importa, \"\" disse Sudou, a bater os seus dois braços em fists e então a torná-los juntos à sua frente, duramente. \"\" Quanto à Horikita se referia, a proposta de Amasawa era tanto um produto de acaso como uma oportunidade preciosa. \"\" Okey dokey, eu publiquei uma mensagem geral na aplicação para que todos vejam. \"\" Vou dizer a quem se\"Heh. Sem importar quem apareça, eu lerei-os.\" Convenientemente, Sudou não pareceu entender o que Horikita estava a pensar. Ele estava provavelmente a ficar entusiasmado com a ideia de lutar contra alguém de mão em mão. \"Vai ficar bem se escolhermos a localização? Preferiríamos não deixar intencionalmente as coisas deslizarem para a escola,\" disse Horikita. \"Sim, claro. Acho que vocês provavelmente saberiam mais sobre isso do que eu, de qualquer forma. Vou deixar-vos lidar com essa parte.\" A Amasawa tem que ter terminado a compôr a sua mensagem, porque ela virou-se para nós para uma confirmação final antes de a enviar. \"Ok, então, uma vez que isto saia, teremos o nosso pequeno teste de força. Está bem contigo?\"Horikita concordou em resposta. A Amasawa olhou devagarTinha pensado que talvez tivesse uma mudança de coração repentina, mas isso não parecia ser o caso. Concluindo com a expressão na cara dela, deveríamos presumir que ela tinha estado a testar-nos, a tentar sentir-nos. No entanto, tanto Horikita como Sudou ficaram chocadas pela mudança brusca de Amasawa. \"O que é que não está?\" perguntou Horikita. \" Mesmo se eu colocar uma mensagem a pedir às pessoas, não parece que alguém apareça. Segundo o corpo físico do Sudou-senpai, e a forma como os dois Horikita-senpai e Ayanokouji-senpai estão a agir, posso dizer que ele é o melhor cão em termos de força no seu nível de ensino, \"\" disse Amasawa.Então ela compreendia que não havia necessidade de passar pelo problema de fazer as pessoas lutar para as comparar. Parecia que o pequeno acto que Horikita e eu tínhamos feito, assim como a reação natural de Sudou, tinha sido ainda mais eficaz do que esperávamos. Se Amasawa só tivesse reparado em tudo isto depois de ter publicado a mensagem, Horikita provavelmente não a deixaria voltar a pegar. Para não deixar que Amasawa se apercebasse de que tínhamos estado a agir antes, Horikita expressou a sua insatisfação.Horikita estava a tentar manter o controlo da conversa, mas continuou a ficar desequilibrada pela abordagem peculiar de Amasawa. Parecia que ela não se axeitava tão bem com pessoas como Amasawa. \"Bem, acho que, para além de homens fortes, gosto de homens que conseguem cozinhar,\" disse Amasawa. \"Cozinhar?\" disse Horikita. A proposta mais nova de Amasawa foi uma vez mais algo que não tinha nada a ver com o exame especial. \"Então, Sudou-senpai, certo? Poderiam-me fazer uma refeição cozinhada em casa? Alguma coisa como, super extra saborosa?\" disse Amasawa. \"Uma refeição cozinhada em casa?!\" disse Sudou. Sudou, que tinha estado impregnado de confiança há alguns momentos atrás, agora parecia superado com choque depois de ouvir a sua pergunta in\"É assim? Bem, acho que isso significa que vou dar-vos uma oportunidade, hmm,\" respondeu Amasawa, cortando-o.Horikita saltou para a conversa, sem querer deixar esta oportunidade passar por nós. \"Conseguirei-o então, no lugar do Sudou-kun?\" \"Não. Já vos disse antes, não era? Disse que gosto de homens que conseguem cozinhar. ’Sides, se o tipo com quem estou a parceria não consegue cozinhar, então não há sentido em parceria com eles de todo, \"\" disse Amasawa. O que significa que não importa como bem Horikita poderia cozinhar. Se fossem raparigas, Amasawa não estava interessado.\"Bem, se o Sudou-senpai não é bom, porque não desistir dele e tentar encontrar um colega de turma que possa cozinhar? Oh, é porque mesmo se fossem sair e encontrar alguém em pressa, eu ainda não estaria a fazer parte do Sudou-senpai então, hm?\" disse Amasawa, a brilhar um sorriso devilheiro. \"Talvez deveríamos trabalhar em tornar o Sudou-senpai num cozinheiro-mestre. Claro, tenho que me perguntar se podem realmente fazer isso em tempo, hm. Eu sou muito popular, sabem. Se não se precipitarem, provavelmente encontrarei um parceiro.\"Isso não era apenas uma ameaça vazia. Ela provavelmente encontraria um parceiro no futuro não tão distante. Havia muitos estudantes excecionalmente talentosos além do Horikita no nosso nível de ensino. Não havia necessidade de Amasawa tomar deliberadamente o risco de parceria com os como o Sudou. Se alguma coisa, isto não era mais do que uma piada divertida em sua parte. Se ela mudou a sua mente um pouco, isso seria o fim. Mas um colega de turma que tinha notas fracas e era um tipo que era bom a cozinhar? Ninguém mais veio à cabeça neste momento. Nesse caso, esta pergunta de Amasawa pode ser apenas um \"\" não-go \"\" para a Classe D. Assajar-se dela e ir atrás de outros estudantes seria provavelmente uma melhor utilização do nosso tempo. Quando Amasawa viu que não lhe damos uma resposta, ela continuou a acrescentar outra coisa.\"Ok. Bem, que tal dar-vos um pequeno tratamento especial? Eu queria parceria com um homem que é bom a cozinhar, mas... se você pode satisfazer os meus papilas gustativas, eu estaria disposto a juntar-me a um bom combatente como o Sudou-senpai,\" disse Amasawa. Ela estava a oferecer-nos um compromisso. Amasawa queria juntar-se a um homem que era um bom combatente ou um bom cozinheiro. Nesse caso, nós certamente a poderíamos satisfazer. \"\" Suponho que seria como juntar-se a um bom cozinheiro e a um bom combatente ao mesmo tempo, eh?\" acrescentou ela. Amasawa estava a dizer que estaria disposta a juntar-se a Sudou desde que outro tipo a pudesse satisfazer. Perguntei-me como a Horikita responderia...?“Ayanokouji-kun. Se me lembro, te gabaste, uma vez, de ser mesmo o cozinheiro qualificado, não é?” disse Horikita. O que é que Horikita estava a pensar, a perguntar-me uma pergunta assim tão aberta? Eu nunca lhe disse nada do género, muito menos a gabar-me sobre isso. embora tivesse sido fácil para mim negar a sua afirmação, pareceu-me necessário brincar com ela e fazer com que as nossas histórias coincidissem. As hipóteses de Sudou ser capaz de parceria com um aluno com um A em capacidades académicas não eram exatamente altas. “Não seria uma exageração dizer que cozinhar é a minha única e única área de especialização, ” disse eu. “Sim, muito bem. Bem então, se a permitires, Amasawa-san, como é com Ayanokouji-kun?” perguntou Horikita\"\" Enquanto é um tipo, não me importa quem. Mas ele é realmente um bom cozinheiro, embora? Quer dizer, podem ir para a frente e dizer o que quiserem, a conversa é barata, mas eu vou-vos julgar muito duramente, ok?\" disse Amasawa. \"\" Isto vai ficar bem, claro. Não é isso mesmo? \"\" disse Horikita, virando-se para mim. \"\" Sim, acho que sim. \"\" Assim que aceitou, Amasawa aplaudiu imediatamente as suas mãos. \"\" Ok! E que tal obter este espectáculo na estrada e mostrar-me o que podem fazer? \"\" As coisas estavam a mover-se muito rapidamente. Contudo, o que Amasawa tinha acabado de dizer parecia que estava a fechar o negócio e a dar-nos um ultimatum. Ela queria evitar dar-me o suficiente de um período de graça para que euComo Horikita precisava de se certificar que Amasawa acreditava na sua mentira, ela não podia prosseguir e dizer sim à sua pergunta. Mesmo que eu fosse prosseguir e cozinhar para Amasawa agora, com o meu nível actual de conhecimento, era claro que não iria equivaler a muito. E mesmo que Amasawa não me julgesse assim tão duramente, provavelmente eu continuaria a falhar nos seus padrões.\"\" Enquanto gostaríamos, \"\" poderemos dar-nos um pouco de tempo? Ayanokouji-kun e eu estamos no processo de chegar aos alunos do primeiro ano para encontrarmos parceiros para os nossos colegas de turma. \"\" Para além do Sudou-kun, há muitos outros alunos que precisam de ajuda. Se as outras turmas nos baterem pelo punho, \"\" então vamos mesmo ter problemas. Mesmo neste preciso momento, os nossos rivais estão a lutar para encontrarem parceiros \"\", disse Horikita, explicando a nossa situação a Amasawa, \"\" para ver se ela compreendia com o que estávamos a lidar. \"\" Se é possível, \"\" gostaríamos de pôr isto em suspenso até depois da aula em sexta-feira \"\". Achau a pedido de Amasawa \"\" de me fazer cozinhar algo para ela imediatamente. Mais do que isso, ela perguntou\"\" Eu vejo, eu vejo. Bem, suponho que estão certos, não seria bom para o pequeno ol'me dedicar todo o vosso tempo a mim próprio \"\". Então Amasawa ofereceu uma nova proposta. \"\" Eu estaria bem a fazer isso mais tarde, no entanto. E que tal? Não seria um problema, não seria? \"\" \"\" Um estudante de primeiro ano a ir para o albergue de um estudante de segundo ano no meio da noite - e um rapaz para começar - seria certamente inadequado \"\", disse Horikita. \"Oh, eu vejo. Mas esperar até o fim de semana é um pouco duro para mim. \"\" E eu perderia a oportunidade de associar-me com qualquer outro dos meus senpai então... Certo?\" Tal como eu pensava, a proposta de Horikita de esperar até o fim de semana não ia vir a voar. Amasawa voltou com\"\" Mas porque isto é tipo, tipo, destino ou algo, \"\" dou-vos apenas um dia. Se me disserem que não podem cozinhar algo para mim amanhã, depois da aula, \"\" acho que só teremos de fingir que tudo isto nunca aconteceu \"\", disse Amasawa. Foi provavelmente o último compromisso que ela estava disposta a fazer. Estava a desenhar uma linha dura. Eu tive a sensação de que se ficassemos demasiado avariados, Amasawa iria retirar-se imediatamente. Se Horikita não se escorregira na sua negociação, \"\" então \"\". Tem razão. Eu certamente não posso negar que a minha pedido lhe colocaria uma grande carga. E além disso, tenho a certeza de que não queiram dar-nos tempo a dar-nos cuidado para praticar cozinhar. Certo?\" disse Horikita. \"Oh, meu Deus, não, eu não pensei queNós só tínhamos um dia de tempo para prepararmo-nos. No entanto, se não nos mantivéssemos a esses termos, não iríamos ser capazes de agarrar a Amasawa. O que Horikita estava a aceitar podia ser interpretado como medidas desesperadas tomadas sob pressão da necessidade, mas ela assinalou que estava a aceitar a proposta modificada tudo o mesmo. \"\" Está resolvido, então. \"\" Amasawa aceitou-se prontamente, sem objeção para se reunir amanhã depois da aula como ela sugeriu anteriormente. \"\" Contudo, isso é desde que não retirem o que disseram, como fizeram antes quando estávamos a falar sobre ter uma luta, \"\" disse Horikita. \"Ok. Eu prometo. Se eu determinar que as suas competências de cozinha são legítimas, então eu juntar-me-ei ao Sudou-senpai mesmo então e lá.\" EmboraDada a situação, pensei que iria brincar com eles. Mas nunca imaginei que as coisas iriam acontecer assim. \"Ok, então, que tal conhecermo-nos à frente do centro comercial Keyaki às quatro treinta amanhã, depois da aula? Seria tudo bem, Ayanokouji-senpai?\" perguntou Amasawa. \"No centro comercial? Não nos dormitórios?\" perguntei em troca. \"O que eu lhe vou pedir que faça é um segredo! E além disso, vais ter que comprar os ingredientes e as coisas para o fazer, certo?\" disse Amasawa. Eu vejo. Então ela ia julgar-me em tudo, começando com o que eu comprei. \"Isso está bem se eu o acompanho também?\" perguntou Horikita, provavelmente à procura de oferecer-me conselhos, para que o nosso ruso não fosse descoberto. Mas o nosso o\n"
